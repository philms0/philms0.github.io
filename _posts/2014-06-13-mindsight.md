## Book Name: Mindsight

## Author: Daniel J. Siegel

_Thanks to Mr. Siegel that I gained so much about the mind, how to deal with problems and disorders properly, how to make oneself better through mindsight. **Most of all, He let me know that our mind can always grow and heal. (**_That_ the brain never stops growing in response to experience.**)**_

# Notes about the book

_The human mind is a relational and embodied process that regulates the flow of energy and information._

_When we focus repeatedly on specific skills, moment-to-moment neural activity can gradually become an established trait through the power of neuroplasticity._

_We all long-consciously or not-for what we did not receive in the past and what we don't have now._

When I first began to explore the nature of the mind professionally, there was no term in our everyday language that captured the way we perceive our thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories, beliefs, attitudes, hopes, dreams, and fantasies. Of course, these activities of the mind fill our day-to-day lives-we don't need to learn a skill in order to experience them. But how do we actually develop the ability to perceive a thought-not just have one-and to know it as an activity of our minds so that we are not taken over by it? How can we be receptive to the mind's riches and not just reactive to its reflexes? How can we direct our thoughts and feelings rather than be driven by them? And how can we know the minds of others, so that we truly understand "where they are coming from" and can respond more effectively and compassionately?

# Mindsight-the 7<sup>th</sup> sense

## What is mindsight

Our first five senses allow us to perceive the outside world-to hear a bird's song or a snake's warning rattle, to make our way down a busy street or smell the warming earth of spring. What has been called our sixth sense allows us to perceive our internal bodily states-the quickly beating heart that signals fear or excitement, the sensation of butterflies in our stomach, the pain that demands our attention. Mindsight, our ability to look within and perceive the mind, to reflect on our experience, is every bit as essential to our well-being. Mindsight is our seventh sense.

## What can mindsight do

In our individual lives, mindsight offers us the opportunity to explore the subjective essence of who we are, to create a life of deeper meaning with a richer and more understandable internal world. With mindsight we are better able to balance our emotions, achieving an internal equilibrium that enables us to cope with the small and large stresses of our lives. Through our ability to focus attention, mindsight also helps the body and brain achieve homeostasis-the internal balance, coordination, and adaptiveness that forms the core of health. Finally, mindsight can improve our relationships with our friends, colleagues, spouses, and children-and even the relationship we have with our own selves.

### How we focus our attention shapes the structure of the brain.

When we develop the skill of mindsight, we actually change the physical structure of the brain. Developing the lens that enables us to see the mind more clearly stimulates the brain to grow important new connections. This revelation is based on one of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the last twenty years: How we focus our attention shapes the structure of the brain. Neuroscience supports the idea that developing the reflective skills of mindsight activates the very circuits that create resilience and well-being and that underlie empathy and compassion as well. Neuroscience has also definitively shown that we can grow these new connections throughout our lives, not just in childhood.

Here we see living evidence for another exciting discovery of modern neuroscience: that the brain never stops growing in response to experience. And this is true for people with happy childhoods, too. Even if we had positive relationships with our care-givers and parents early on-and even if we write books on the subject-we can continue as long as we live to keep developing our vital seventh sense and promoting the connections and integration that are at the heart of well-being.

# Limblic system

Mainly two parts: hypothalamus and amygdala

## Limblic area - the motion

This limblic system works closely with the brainstem and the body proper to create not only our basic drives but also our emotions. These feeling states are filled with a sense of meaning because the limbic regions evaluate our current situation. "Is this good or is this bad?" is the most basic question the limbic area addresses. We move toward the good and withdraw from the bad. In this way the limbic regions help create the "e-motions" that "evoke motion," that motivate us to act in response to the meaning we assign to whatever is happening to us in that moment.

## Limblic area and relationships

The limbic area is also crucial for how we form relationships and become emotionally attached to one another. If you've ever raised fish, or frogs, or lizards, you know that these nonmammalian creatures lack attachment to you-and to one another. Rats, cats, and dogs, on the other hand, are equipped with a mammalian limbic region. Attachment is just what they-and we-do. We are hardwired to connect with one another thanks to our mammalian heritage.

### Stress is toxic to brain and health

The limbic area plays an important regulatory role through the hypothalamus, a master endocrine control center. Via the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus sends and receives hormones throughout the body-especially influencing our sexual organs and the thyroid and adrenal glands. For example, when we are stressed we secrete a hormone that stimulates the adrenals to release cortisol, which mobilizes energy by putting our entire metabolism on high alert to meet the challenge. This response is highly adaptive in the face of short-term stress, but it can turn into a problem in the long term. If we face an overwhelming situation in which we cannot adequately cope, cortisol levels may become chronically elevated. Traumatic experiences, in particular, can sensitize limbic reactivity, so that even minor stresses can cause cortisol to spike, making daily life more challenging for the traumatized person. These high cortisol levels can also be toxic to the growing brain and interfere with proper growth and function of neural tissue. Finding a way to soothe excessively reactive limbic firing is crucial to rebalancing emotions and diminishing the harmful effects of chronic stress. As we'll see, mindsight can help us recruit the higher areas of the brain to create a "cortical override" of these limbic reactivities.

The almond-shaped amygdala has been found to be especially important in the fear response. The amygdala can prompt an instantaneous survival response.

### Hippocampus help link the pieces together to form the memories

the hippocampus, a sea horse-shaped cluster of neurons that functions as a master "puzzle-piece-assembler," linking together widely separated areas of the brain-from our perceptual regions to our repository for facts to our language centers. This integration of neural firing patterns converts our moment-to-moment experiences into memories. I can relate the snake story to you because my hippocampus linked together the various aspects of that experience-sensations in my body, emotions, thoughts, facts, reflections-into a lived-in-time set of recollections. The hippocampus develops gradually during our early years and continues to grow new connections and even new neurons throughout our lives. As we mature, the hippocampus weaves the basic forms of emotional and perceptual memory into factual and autobiographical recollections, laying the foundation for my ability to tell you about that long-ago snake encounter in the Sierras. However, this uniquely human storytelling ability also depends upon the development of the highest part of the brain, the cortex.

Rage can also shut off the hippocampus, and people with out-of-control anger may not be lying when they say they don't recall what they said or did in that altered state of mind. Recent research suggests that other states of high emotion-beyond those we can normally tolerate-may also shut off the hippocampus by way of the high levels of stress they create. Excessive stress-hormone release in a state of terror, for example, may disrupt hippocampal integration.

# Scenario-game of sibling chess

If you have more than one child at home, or if you've grown up with a brother or sister, you may be very familiar with the game of sibling chess, strategic interactions filled with ever-present sets of movements aimed to assert power and achieve parental recognition and approval.

After a while my daughter asked me why I had yelled at her brother, just about a crepe. Good question. I told her I thought sharing was important (lame excuse, I know, but that's what I thought at the time). At that moment, I felt a flow of associations rise up in my mind like the pages of a photo album from my childhood, the pictures flashing by in front of my eyes. I came to realize that what happened is that I saw my daughter as a symbol of myself when I was a child and my son as a symbol of my older brother when he was a teen. I had images of my brother playing with me when we were young, and even protecting me from other kids when we both were in elementary school. But when he became a teenager, we no longer got along so well and rarely shared time together. Even though he and I are close as adults and we laugh about those days now, back then it was a painful time for me.

## Openness, observation, and objectivity

_Being kind to ourselves actually helps us to take the necessary steps toward repair and reconnection. It also helps to be prepared for being rebuffed initially, since this often happens when we first try to make a repair. Without such preparation, we may rapidly reenter the disintegrated state, reinforcing and hardening the disconnection we are trying to undo. Before we reconnect with others, we need to be sure we are connected with ourselves._

_But reflection requires an attunement to the self that is supportive and kind, not a judgmental stance of interrogation and derogation. Reflection is a compassionate state of mind._

The key to the reflective dialogue I engaged in with my son was maintaining the three components of openness, observation, and objectivity. Each of these elements enables a powerful source of healing to emerge following a disruption in our relationships, and each of them is an essential part of the kindness we need to extend after such disruptions.

## Repair-a life journey

As a wise professor of mine once said, "_Uncovering memory and meaning are never over until life is over_." He was so right. Even with intellectual understanding and reflective insights, we are still fallible, still human, still refining our mindsight skills. That day of crepes and cries and skates and insights had become part of our family's shared story. The repair process that we had engaged in following the turmoil had led not only to a repair but also to a deeper understanding for all of us. With mindsight our standard is honesty and humility, not some false ideal of perfection and invulnerability. We are all human, and seeing our minds clearly helps us embrace that humanity within one another and ourselves.

# How evolution shapes the brain

## Synaptic connections-experience

But from our first days of life, our immature brain is also directly shaped by our interactions with the world, and especially by our relationships. Our experiences stimulate neural firing and sculpt our emerging synaptic connections. This is how experience changes the structure of the brain itself-and could even end up having an influence on our innate temperament. As we grow, then, an intricate weaving together of the genetic, chance, and experiential input into the brain shapes what we call our "personality," with all its habits, likes, dislikes, and patterns of response. If you've always had positive experiences with dogs and have enjoyed having them in your life, you may feel pleasure and excitement when a neighbor's new dog comes bounding toward you. But if you've ever been severely bitten, your neural firing patterns may instead help create a sense of dread and panic, causing your entire body to shrink away from the pooch. If on top of having had a prior bad experience with a dog you also have a shy temperament, such an encounter may be even more fraught with fear.

_But whatever your experience and underlying temperament, transformation is possible. Learning to focus your attention in specific therapeutic ways can help you override that old coupling of fear with dogs. The intentional focus of attention is actually a form of self-directed experience: It stimulates new patterns of neural firing to create new synaptic linkages._

_Trying to change how we actually feel by ordering ourselves to do so is a strategy that goes nowhere, fast. Open awareness is about accepting what is and not being swept up by those judging activities._

# Mirror neuron system

This mirror neuron system has since been identified in human beings and is now considered the root of empathy. Beginning from the perception of a basic behavioral intention, our more elaborated human prefrontal cortex enables us to map out the minds of others. Our brains use sensory information to create representations of others' minds, just as they use sensory input to create images of the physical world. The key is that mirror neurons respond only to an act with intention, with a predictable sequence or sense of purpose. If I simply lift up my hand and wave it randomly, your mirror neurons will not respond. But if I carry out any act you can predict from experience, your mirror neurons will "figure out" what I intend to do before I do it. So when I lift up my hand with a cup in it, you can predict at a synaptic level that I intend to drink from the cup. Not only that, the mirror neurons in the premotor area of your frontal cortex will get you ready to drink as well. We see an act and we ready ourselves to imitate it. At the simplest level, that's why we get thirsty when others drink, and why we yawn when others yawn. At the most complex level, mirror neurons help us understand the nature of culture and how our shared behaviors bind us together, mind to mind. The internal maps created by mirror neurons are automatic-they do not require consciousness or effort. We are hardwired from birth to detect sequences and make maps in our brains of the internal state-the intentional stance-of other people. And this mirroring is "cross-modal"-it operates in all sensory channels, not just vision-so that a sound, a touch, a smell, can cue us to the internal state and intentions of another.

As I consider the resonance circuits, two mind lessons stand out for me. One is that becoming open to our body's states-the feelings in our heart, the sensations in our belly, the rhythm of our breathing-is a powerful source of knowledge. The insula flow that brings up this information and energy colors our cortical awareness, shaping how we reason and make decisions. We cannot successfully ignore or suppress these subcortical springs. Becoming open to them is a gateway to clear mindsight.

# Life is balance of rigidity and chaos

Sometimes we move toward the bank of rigidity-we feel stuck. Other days we lean toward chaos-life feels unpredictable and out of control. But in general, when we are well and at ease, we move along this winding path of harmony, the integrated flow of a flexible system. We sense the familiar but are not trapped by it. We live at the threshold of the unknown and have the courage to move into new and uncharted waters. This is living a life as it unfolds, moment by moment, in a flowing journey between rigidity and chaos. This is the FACES flow. An old, dear and now-departed friend, the poet, philosopher, and all around wonderfully wise John O'Donohue, captured the essence of this emergent flow when he said that he'd love to live like a river, carried by the surprise of his own unfolding.

## Judgment creates tension

Our effort to combat our actual experience creates internal tension, a kind of self-inflicted distress. But rather than march into our inner world and say "No-don't do that!" we can embrace what is and notice what happens. Amazingly, time after time people discover that letting things be also allows them to change. We can approach our inner world with openness and acceptance rather than with judgments and preconceptions. Consider this: If a friend came to you with some difficulties, you'd probably listen to her first, invite her to bring up whatever came to mind, and offer her an open heart and a shoulder she could lean on. This is what openness entails-attuning to what is, being kind and supportive to ourselves, letting our state be receptive rather than reactive.

## Left mind VS right mind

The right mode creates an "AND" stance, while the left creates an "OR" point of view. Using my right mode, I see a world full of interconnecting possibilities: This AND that can be true. And together, wow, they could make something new! Using my left mode, I see a world more divided: Is this OR that true? For the left, only one view can accurately reflect reality. And when I'm looking at the world through my left-mode OR lens, I have no sense that I'm choosing to see the world this way. It is the way. And the other way, the right mode, well, it is just plain wrong.

Of course you've noticed the paradox-we were using words to access the wordless right-hemisphere realm of sensations, images, and feelings. Aren't words the left brain's specialty? Yes and no. When we explain a science experiment or a legal proceeding, we are relying heavily on the left. When we describe rather than explain, we are bringing the experientially rich right side into collaboration with the word-smithing left hemisphere. The challenge was to invite Stuart's left to participate but let the right stay strong. This would be the beginning of a more balanced linkage of left and right.

## A shield can also be a fence

No one knows exactly how our mind uses the brain to defend us from pain, but two things we do know from repeated clinical experience. One is that people do this quite often. As you'll see throughout this book, these adaptations can take many forms, from avoiding our feelings momentarily when we are overwhelmed, to long-term shutoffs, or to shutdowns like Anne's. The second thing we know is that somehow we-that is, our minds-can modify neural firing patterns to create what we need. For example, when we need to place something in the front of our mind, to focus our attention, we activate aspects of the prefrontal cortex on either side of the brain. So we can propose that one possible way the mind uses the brain to block something from awareness is by literally dampening the neural passage of energy and information from the subcortical regions upward to the cortex, especially to the parts of the prefrontal region that mediate awareness. Here's another thing we know for sure: When we block our awareness of feelings, they continue to affect us anyway. Research has shown repeatedly that even without conscious awareness, neural input from the internal world of body and emotion influences our reasoning and our decision making. Even facial expressions we're not aware of, even changes in heart rhythm we may not notice, directly affect how we feel and so how we perceive the world. In other words, you can run but you cannot hide.

_Whatever the defense, the idea is the same: We build a fence around our awareness so that we don't feel the anxiety or fear associated with feeling our feelings. These are usually automatic strategies, patterns of reactivity adopted without conscious intention or even recognition, and certainly without free will or choice._

# Past and Future

These six domains of implicit memory-perception, emotion, bodily sensation, behavior, mental models, and priming-are like the basic puzzle pieces of the mind that form the foundation for how the past continues to influence us in the present. After an experience is "over" and we move ahead down the river of time, what remains are these synaptic linkages that shape and filter our present experiences and sensations. Drawing on these implicit elements from the past, the brain-our associational organ and anticipation machine-continually readies us for the future.

## Family has a significant influence

In general, the securely attached children were found to meet their intellectual potential, had good relationships with others, were respected by their peers, and could regulate their emotions well. Although the attachment researchers did not study the brain directly, these overall outcomes parallel our middle prefrontal functions in many ways: securely attached children developed good bodily regulation, attunement to others, emotional balance, response flexibility, fear modulation, empathy and insight, and moral awareness. (The ninth function, intuition, has not been studied yet.) From the viewpoint of interpersonal neurobiology, this strongly suggests that secure parent-child interactions promote the growth of the integrative fibers of the middle prefrontal region of the child's brain.

In contrast, those with an avoidant attachment to their primary caregiver tended to be restricted emotionally, and their peers often described them as aloof, controlling, and unlikable. Children whose primary attachment was ambivalent revealed a great deal of anxiety and insecurity. And those with disorganized attachment were significantly impaired in their ability to relate to others and to regulate their emotions. Further, many had symptoms of dissociation that placed them at heightened risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event.

Naturally, who we become as adults is shaped by many factors-including genes, chance, and experience-in addition to our earliest attachments to our caregivers. But anyone who doubts the influence parents have on their children must deal with these extensive studies of attachment. They demonstrate clearly that what parents do matters enormously.

# Making sense of the past to free the present

Impact of those events on our development into adulthood-these are all the stuff of our life stories. The answers people give to these fundamental questions also reveal how this internal narrative-the story they tell themselves-may be limiting them in the present and may also be causing them to pass down to their children the same painful legacy that marred their own early days. If, for example, your parent had a rough childhood and was unable to make sense of what happened, he or she would be likely to pass on that harshness to you-and you, in turn, would be at risk for passing it along to your children. Yet parents who had a tough time in childhood but did make sense of those experiences were found to have children who were securely attached to them. They had stopped handing down the family legacy of no secure attachment.

The key to making sense is what the researchers came to call a "life narrative"-the way we put our story into words to convey it to another person. How an adult told his or her story turned out to be highly revealing. For example, people who were securely attached tended to acknowledge both positive and negative aspects of their family experiences, and they were able to show how these experiences related to their later development. They could give a coherent account of their past and how they came to be who they are as adults. In contrast, people who had challenging childhood experiences often had a life narrative that was incoherent in the various ways I'll describe in the following pages. The exceptions were people like Rebecca. Based on the facts of their early childhood, they would be expected to have an avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganized attachment as children and an incoherent life narrative as adults.

## Memory is fallible

The AAI evaluation accepts that memory is fallible. As you've seen, memory is not a photocopy machine, and it's highly suggestible, readily conforming to others' expectations-and to our own. Even at our most honest moments we say things we think others expect to hear, and we say them in ways that make us appear as we want to appear. For these reasons the analysis does not presume the accuracy of the facts as stated. Instead it focuses on the coherence of the story.

### Writing down helps

Studies have suggested that simply writing down our account of a challenging experience can lower physiological reactivity and increase our sense of well-being, even if we never show what we've written to anyone else.

## Integrate past for future

Early experience is not fate: If we can make sense of our past-if we integrate our narratives-we can free ourselves from what might otherwise be a cross-generational legacy of pain and insecure attachment. Rebecca has always served as an inspiration for me for how taking responsibility for one's own mind can lead to liberation of the self, and to the ability to offer nurturance and love to the next generation.

### How to deal with subterranean shame

In life we do the best we can, but the shame-based conviction that we are defective, which often goes underground, beneath our cortical consciousness, can sabotage us if it remains unconscious.

subterranean shame can compel us to succeed-to prove we are good and worthy of others' respect and admiration-our developmentally ancient feelings of being damaged goods are likely to surface at any hint of stress or failure, and we may become highly reactive in order to keep others at a distance. We need to prevent them-and ourselves-from becoming aware of our shadowy past, the hidden truth of our rotten self. In our personal lives, intimacy is compromised because the closer others come to the real self beneath our public persona, the more vulnerable we feel and the more alarmed we are that this secret truth about our defective nature may be revealed.

# Perception

The flow of information through a cortical column is not just from input to output; it is not one-directional. Cortical column flow is bidirectional.

Learning how perception is shaped by the architecture of the cortical columns helped Matthew begin to make sense of his unintegrated states of mind. He followed closely when I described how interactions with our parents shape our neural development and top-down filters, and he was intrigued by the notion that it's normal to have different-and even conflicting-states of mind. The challenge, he came to understand, is not to get rid of top-down influences (we can't), but to become aware when a given self-state is reactive from the past and not receptive to the present. I also wanted to make sure he understood how strongly top-down flow can dominate bottom-up input. _When we are on autopilot, our awareness "believes" what it perceives. There is no mindsight, and our state-dependent perceptions, emotional reactions, beliefs, and behavioral responses are felt to be justified, equated with absolute reality, not discerned as just activities of the mind_. Before therapy, Matthew's "intuition" and "gut feelings" were telling him his girlfriends were repulsive and he was totally convinced by this distorted top-down communication. Top-down forces can shape what we think in the blink of an eye, distort the reliability of our instinctual responses, and challenge our most cherished sense of free will.

## Scenario-Conflict of states

What if our basic motivational states are in conflict? Some states collaborate well (sexuality and play, for example) but others clash. So we need to find a way to embrace strong motivational drives that exist side by side: our need for focused mastery and our need for open-ended play; our drive to monitor our resources (of time, energy, money, food, etc.) and our drive to reproduce (children cost us a lot in energy, money, and food-which is as true for modern city dwellers as it was for early humans); our need for exploration (to follow our individual creative interests) and our need for social affiliation (to remain members in good standing of our family or community requires fitting in with others). These built-in contradictions are one reason that balance and variety are so essential to our health.

In fact, at this stage of his life, the "right" person Matthew needed to find was himself. While one self-state wanted closeness and intimacy, another self-state needed to protect his vulnerability, and yet another needed to prove his self-worth. These states were clustered in different firing patterns in Matthew's brain-filtering his perceptions quite differently from the "closeness-seeking" state.

Think of Matthew's cortical columns: In a closeness state, he sees this attractive woman, his girlfriend. In that state, he perceives her as "right" for him in so many ways-her intellect, her sexuality, her personality, her humor. These are the reasons he is drawn to her. But then as she grows more fond of him, as she comes to like the wonderful person that he is (and he can be quite wonderful and kind), "something" shifts in him. That shift, Matthew and I came to understand, was the activation of another set of self-states.

Shame organized Matthew's self-states into a number of related but distinct clusters. One was simply protective-if his girlfriend is interested in him she might get to know him and discover that he is, deep inside, a jerk. Better to leave her before she finds out. This state also protected him from the threat of sexual failure: If he really wanted to be close to a woman, if their relationship truly mattered, then the idea that he might "screw things up" was so distressing that it was better to end the relationship before he did-just as, in his twenties, it had been better to have sex with women he didn't care about so that it didn't matter how he did. This was one of the many-layered reasons Matthew became self-conscious and lost interest sexually once his girlfriend liked him "too much." Another shame-based self-state was more punitive. If she really liked him, how could he ever forgive her? Does that line of reasoning sound irrational?

_Here's the logic: If a woman likes me, there must be something wrong with her. So why would I want to be with her? Shame explains that equation._ When we have a deep belief that the self is defective, all of these "irrational" responses make total sense.

Then, after a pause, he told me he had realized something: that no matter what happened with the women in his life, he could never prove that his mother was kind and loving to him. And no matter how many women he had, he could never prove to his parents that he was a lovable person.

# Question and the answer

Our minds wrestle with uncertainty all the time, but now I was entering a profession where my drive to know, to be sure, would be activated day and night. Temporal integration was not a luxury, but rather front and center in the work of caring for others. Today more than ever, medicine is wrestling with these issues. Computer programs enable us to offer precise, step-by-step checklists to help medical staff perform complex procedures accurately. In some areas these checklists have dramatically reduced human error and the resulting complications, including death. But no matter how many checklists we devise, we need to remain open to the wisdom of our whole selves as well, to listen to the intuition that is also the gift of the prefrontal cortex. We then can not only check, but ultimately feel, with clarity, that we've taken care of what needs to be done.

Ultimately, wrestling with transience and mortality requires that we dive beneath the illusion of permanence and seek deeper meaning in our lives. We seek comfort and meaning in various ways, from religion to science, from shared rituals to impassioned personal pursuits. Some of these pursuits are a form of facing up to our existential anxieties, others a form of escaping them.

We humans spend a lot of energy not facing reality. Sometimes we become absorbed in the day-to-day realities of meeting our essential needs-because much if not most of the time we do need simply to do our homework, go to work, take out the trash, walk the dog, and brush our teeth. We may also seek comfort in the world of the physical, absorbed in the consumption of material goods or getting addicted to the thrill of adrenaline-pumping activities. Yet these are temporary escapes. When we pause from our driven behaviors, we can become overwhelmed with anxiety or lost in a sense of internal emptiness. Without what I am calling temporal integration, we will drift to the banks of either chaos or rigidity.

Our human ingenuity and technical skill can mask our fundamental insecurity. Even the first human being who started a fire using friction and flint must have felt a new command over nature. Knowledge meant survival, whether we found food by distinguishing safe plants from poisonous ones or could predict the seasonal migration of zebra and wildebeests. We have an innate drive to seek out predictable situations. We also come hardwired with a preference for familiar faces-the brain's basic system for knowing whom to trust or discerning who is a member of our clan. These ancient sensations, these drives to feel connected and to be certain, are often directly in conflict with the demands of contemporary culture. We can spend an entire day in a modern city recognizing no one, seeing literally thousands of faces and losing ourselves in anonymity. Our global society, dominated as it is by our drive for mastery, also gives us too much knowledge-flooding us with news of the incalculable daily disasters that can destroy our security in an instant. What happens there is known here as quickly as the click of a mouse. What can we do? Our species adapts, learns to make do, to live in megacities of millions, bombarded by information from around the planet. But many of us find that we either numb ourselves to cope or we become painfully aware of the fragility of our condition. How do we find peace of mind? Where are the spaces, the mental sanctuaries, where we can put our heads down on a pillow, certain of our personal and collective survival? The longing for simplicity and shelter still stirs in our synaptic circuitry.

Yet experience also teaches us the limits of our control. Even with our best efforts, accidents happen. Life is unpredictable. Temporal integration requires that we let go of the illusion of certainty so that we do what we can to be safe but then release our minds from irrational striving for omniscience and omnipotence. The beautiful serenity prayer used in Alcoholics Anonymous evokes this letting-go process: "May I have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." Serenity, courage, and wisdom are at the heart of temporal integration.

## Mindsight- the approach

This shutting off of circuits of compassion may be one explanation for our violent history as a species. Without mindsight, people become objects, rather than subjects themselves with minds like ours worthy of respecting and even knowing. Under threat, we may distort what we see in others, project our own fears onto their intentions, and imagine that they will harm us. We may also perceive malevolence where none exists, and then retreat to the fight-flight-freeze survival reactions of a threatened state of mind. If the threatened state creates within us a "fight" response, then we get the object out of our way however possible. Feeling threatened takes over our perception. Sometimes this is to our benefit, as when I "saw" that snake just steps ahead of my son on a mountain trail and later became aware of feeling fear. But at other times the same brain mechanism.

Such "mortality salience" studies have shown repeatedly that with people "like us," we become kinder and extend ourselves more to care for their welfare. They are seen as members of our clan, fellow inhabitants of our cave, and we protect them from the harm we've been primed sub-liminal to fear. If, on the other hand, the people are "not like us," we are more likely to treat them with disdain and disregard-as if they were potential enemies and perpetrators of harm. We banish them more easily, create more intense punishments for any wrongdoing, and judge them more harshly. Without awareness of these mechanisms of the mind that classify "like me" and "not like me" during moments of threat, our humanity is at risk. In our global, instant-information, high-tech world, not having the mindsight to disengage these rapid, subcortically driven alarms can have dire consequences. When we become survival-driven, we lose any or all of the nine middle prefrontal functions that Barbara lost when she "lost her soul," and we are primed to travel down a low road. When we are reactive, we revert to primitive behaviors without flexibility or compassion. We act impulsively, lose the ability to balance our emotions, and fail to exert moral reasoning. Both individual behavior and public policy can be shaped by these unexamined autopilot neural responses. Instead of being guided by understanding and compassionate concern, even for those who threaten us, our mind-sightless response is to become hostile and inflexible, and to lose our moral compass.
