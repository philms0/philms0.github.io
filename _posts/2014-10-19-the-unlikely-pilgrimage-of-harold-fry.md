**You have to believe. It's not about medicine and all that staff.you have to believe a person can get better. There is so much in the human mind we don't understand. But, you see, if you have faith, you can do anything.**

'Good on you, mate.' It was with those words in mind that Harold had rushed out to telephone his wife. He wished she could have said the same things' think not.' Sometimes her words sliced down on his before they had even reached his mouth.

_If we don't go mad once in a while, there is no hope_

You'd think walking should be the simplest thing,' She said at last. 'Just a question of putting one foot in front of the other. But it never ceases to amaze me how difficult the things that are supposed to be instinctive really are.' 'Eating, That's another one. Some people have real difficulties with that. Talking too. Even loving. They can all be difficult'(_things can always be simple or difficult,It depends)_

It wasn't her leaving that was the worst part. It was the fact she couldn't even spell her explanation.

For ten days he had walked, and all his energy had been focused into the sheer act of putting one step in front of the other. But now that he had discovered his faith in his feet, the practical anxieties had been replaced by something far more insidious.

The reason she had stayed with Harold all these years was not David. It wasn't even because she felt sorry for her husband. _She had stayed because, however lonely she was with Harold, the world without him would be even more desolate._

**It was hard to understand a little and then walk away.**

He had thought it started the moment he decided to walk to Berwick, but he saw now that he had been naïve. Beginnings could happen more than once, or in different ways. You could think you were starting something afresh, when actually what you were doing was carrying on as before. He had faced his shortcomings and overcome them, and so the real business of walking was happening only now.

**He had wanted more than he could physically give, and so his walk had become a battle against himself, and he had failed**.Once more, it surprised him how much was at his feet, if only he had known to look.

**Harold could no longer pass a stranger without acknowledging the truth that everyone was the same, and also unique; and that this was the dilemma of being human.**

When you rang and told us about your walk, I was afraid you'd misunderstood the gravity of things. But, you see, I was wrong. It's a rather unusual kind of healing. I don't know how you came up with it. But maybe it's what the world need. A little less sense, and a little more faith.

I miss her all the time. I know in my heart that she has gone, but I still keep looking. The only difference is that I am getting used to the pain. It's like discovering a great hole in the ground. To begin with, you forget it's there and you keep falling in. After a while, it's still there, but you learn to walk round it.

I'm not better than anyone else. I'm really not. Anybody can do what I'm doing. But you have to let go. I didn't know that at the beginning but now I do. You have to let go of the things you think you need, like cash cards and phones and maps and things.

But it was never a race. It was the journey that mattered.

**It was easier to give up than keep moving**

No one was expecting him and so no one appeared to notice his arrival or his departure.

You got up, and you did something. And if trying to find a way when you don't even know you can get there isn't miracle, then I don't know what is.

**If we can't be open, if we can't accept what we don't know, there really is no hope.**

That was the thing, love. It was ordinary. It must have been funny because we were happy.
