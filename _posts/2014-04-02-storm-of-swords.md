_Finished reading on April Fool's Day because of the cold and fever._
The last section about Lady Catelyen's revive seems a bit horrible. And can't wait to find out the vengeance in the next volume (**[A Feast For Crows](https://philms.today/2014/04/26/a-feast-for-crows)**).

# Jon Snow

With the command of Halfhand, he walked with the wildlings and fell in love with Yegrrite after proving him an oathbroker. With the help of Summer(Bran's wolf),he escaped from the wildling though nearly dead. And when he returned the Wall,he has to face the attack of the wildlings with the short of brothers as well as the distrust. At last ,King Stannis came and made a sudden onslaught to the wildlings and captured the King-Beyound-the-Wall, while Jon protected his newborn baby and the princess of the Wildlings.

Jon Snow was voted as the Lord Commander when the predecessor-Lord Mornment's raven flied out of the kettle and directly alighted on his shoulder, though both his dead brother Robb Stark and King Stannis also wanted knight him the Lord of Witerfall to get the alliance of north.

# Jamie Lannister

With the hope of her two daughters' return, Lady Catelyen commanded Brienne of Tarth to deliver Jamie to King's Landing. During the rough journey, he first fought against and then with her. Got himself crippled when captured by Voat Goat(The captain of the Brave Companions).

When he finally returned the dreamed place, he found his son be poisoned, his brother in jail,his sister no longer the one, his father disappointed, and the most tragic and irony: himself crippled and that he became the Captain of the WhiteCloak. When he began to record every knight that once served as a whitecloak, he found that he seemed had not done one thing that is significant and most of the page was blank. With the black and grey memory about the past few years with the accompany of Brienne, he made his choice, never be the oathbreaker and the kingslayer again. Thus he gave his new sword that made of the Ice(Eddard Stark's great sword) to her and bid her to find Sensa and protect her. He also free his dwarf brother by persuade Vasys.(While before fled, Tyrion Lannister went back to the Tower of King's Hand and killed Shea and his father Tywin Lannister for vengeance )

Jaime felt almost sorry for Robb Stark. He won the war on the battlefield and lost it in a bedchamber, poor fool.

That was the first time that Jaime understood. It was not his skill with sword and lance that had won him his white cloak, nor any feats of valor he'd performed against the Kingswood Brotherhood. Aerys had chosen him to spite his father, to rob Lord Tywin of his heir.

Others.

Bran went through the wall with Sam's help to search the three-eye gold crow.

Arya got the cabin of a boat toward the Wall with the coin from the Freecites.(After she abandoned the Hound who got hurt by his brother's men)(Lord Bolton pass a false one as her)

Sensa seemed safe with Litterfinger in Vale when he shoved Lady Lysa to the sky with the word that he only loved Cat(Sensa's mother),but why he kissed her?

Robb got himself killed at his uncle's wedding because of his betrayal to the Freys.

Dany settled down in the third city she conquered to rule after the learning of the tragedy of the previous two cites.(she also banished Jorah after learning that he had spied on her.)

Davos became King Stannis's hand and did his best against the witch.

Heretofore Littlefinger seemed to be the most dangerous man .

We have sworn you our faith by earth and water, bronze and iron, ice and fire.

When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.(Why Loras chose to join the whitecloak )

The gods give each of us our little gifts and talents, and it is meant for us to use them. Any act can be a prayer, if done as well as we are able. Isn't that a lovely thought?

Some people hurt others just because they can.

The pointy little buds she was so intent on hiding would have looked more natural on some ten-year-old than they did on her thick muscular chest.（the quips about Brienne）

# About Battle

A man will win one tourney, and fall quickly in the next. A slick spot in the grass may mean defeat, or what you ate for supper the night before. A change in the wind may bring the gift of victory.(The uncertainness of life)

Sometimes I think everyone is just pretending to be brave, and none of us really are. Maybe pretending is how you get brave, I don't know.

Some battles are won with swords and spears, others with quills and ravens.

I don't doubt that you're all very brave, but when it comes to battle, discipline beats valor every time. It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is, if his commands cannot be heard. A man is never so vulnerable in battle as when he flees.

Once you have eaten of his bread and salt, you have the guest right, and the laws of hospitality protect you beneath his roof.(However This time it failed)

# The game of the thrones

Even brave men blind themselves sometimes, when they are afraid to see.

Because knights are fools, and it would have been beneath him to look twice at some poxy peasant. Keep your eyes down and your tone respectful and say ser a lot, and most knights will never see you. They pay more mind to horses than to smallfolk.

He was no innkeeper. The man took too great an interest in our choice of route, and those woods . . . such places are notorious haunts of outlaws. He may have been urging us into a trap.

Davos enjoyed a good story as well as any man, but Stannis had not named him Hand for his enjoyment, he felt. His first duty was to help his king rule, and for that he must needs understand the words the ravens brought.

A bag of dragons buys a man's silence for a while, but a well-placed quarrel buys it forever. All he did he did at my behest. I dared not befriend you openly. When I heard how you saved his life at Joff's tourney, I knew he would be the perfect catspaw.

Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you. Remember that, Sansa, when you come to play the game.

Cersei, for one. She thinks herself sly, but in truth she is utterly predictable. Her strength rests on her beauty, birth, and riches. Only the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her. I pity her then. She wants power, but has no notion what to do with it when she gets it. Everyone wants something, Alayne. And when you know what a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him.

When I came to Highgarden to dicker for Margaery's hand, she let her lord son bluster while she asked pointed questions about Joffrey's nature. I praised him to the skies, to be sure . . . whilst my men spread disturbing tales amongst Lord Tyrell's servants. That is how the game is played. I also planted the notion of Ser Loras taking the white. Not that I suggested it, that would have been too crude. But men in my party supplied grisly tales about how the mob had killed Ser Preston Greenfield and raped the Lady Lollys, and slipped a few silvers to Lord Tyrell's army of singers to sing of Ryam Redwyne, Serwyn of the Mirror Shield, and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. A harp can be as dangerous as a sword, in the right hands.

# The Sounds of City

Look, dawn comes. The sky had turned a cobalt blue from the horizon to the zenith, and behind the line of low hills to the east a glow could be seen, pale gold and oyster pink. Dany held Missandei's hand as they watched the sun come up. All the grey bricks became red and yellow and blue and green and orange. The scarlet sands of the fighting pits transformed them into bleeding sores before her eyes. Elsewhere the golden dome of the Temple of the Graces blazed bright, and bronze stars winked along the walls where the light of the rising sun touched the spikes on the helms of the Unsullied. On the terrace, a few flies stirred sluggishly. A bird began to chirp in the persimmon tree, and then two more. Dany cocked her head to hear their song, but it was not long before the sounds of the waking city drowned them out.
