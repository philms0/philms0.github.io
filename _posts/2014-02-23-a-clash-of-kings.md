# Main characters

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# The Wolfs - The Starks

## Lady Catelyn

with the tidings that her two little ones were slain by Theon, Cat got the truth of Ned's death from the Kingslayer, and then commanded Brittne to bring him to King's Landing to exchange her two daughters.

## Jon Snow

the steward of Lord Mormont (Commander of the Night's Watch), went with the halfhand (Qhorin). After surrounded by the wildlings, he was commanded to do the toughest work (yield to the enemy to continue the mission of finding out what the wildlings are seek for and report to the Watch, by killing the halfhand in the presence of enemy).

## Robb Stark

the king of the north, throned by his lords, nearly won all the battles that he took. However, the Winterfall taken by Theon and his brother's death might lead to his fail.

## Sensa Stark

the little bird that still trapped in King's landing, finally found the knight willing to save her, though nearly a fool. The happy thing was that she was no longer betrothed to Joffrey ,the king of the realm and the son of the incest.

## Arya Stark

for her saving the three horrible people, she rewarded with three lifes and grasped the opportunity to save the northmen. After being the page of the lord of the castle for a littler while, she got the valor to flee from the castle with the other two at the end.

## Brandon Stark

Opened his third eye, that was he could foresee things in his dream. And they succeed in disguising they are dead when Theon wanted their death. His fate in the north was waiting for him, where he in Hodor basket, with his wolf Summer aside, and the company of Meera and Jojen , began the journey. While his brother Rikkon went with Osha the other direction, in order to separate the two heirs of Winterfall for danger.

# The Lions -The Lannisters

## Tyrion Lannister

a dwarf ,and nearly a bastard of Lord Tyell, but a man with wit. Because of him , the King's Landing avoided corruption from the siege of King Stannis , who employed the dark magic to kill his brother for the throne. Truly , he wss much wiser than Ned Stark, cause he only used a trick and then he knew the other three councilors , while pull Ned get killed by trusted in Littlefinger. And also he was brave in the battle and smart enough to keep the city safe.

## Cresei Lannister

the Queen of King Robert and the regent of her son, a fabulous bitch, with little wit but much cunning.

# The mother of the dragons-Daenerys Targaryen

After the birth of her three dragons in the pyre with the price of three lives - her husband her son and the maegi. She traveled to city of Qarth with guide of the comet , where she got the prophecy. At last, she got what she longing for - the ships that could carry her army. And with her three little dragons and the horde, she was on sail back to the seven kingdoms.

# Night's Watch - Qhorin

The half hand - his death is the most touching one- give his soldier the command to kill himself and yield to the enemy to continue the mission for the sake of the Night watch.
"but in your heart, remember who and what you are. Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes. And watch, your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater. What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Momornt and your brothers. Hat is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow "
"I did not command it.

#### I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would be.

When I want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake. Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge. Ebben can make any man give up his secrets. To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow. I know more of you now than I did this morning"

# Notes

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There's no shame in fear, what matters is how we face it.

Power resides where men believe it resides.(So is money)

The ones who look the most suspicious are likely innocent. It's the ones whos look innocent I need to beware.

### Men see what they expect to see.

Why should I betray a secret I have kept so long? It's one thing to deceive a king, and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney.

Sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King's landing, and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy.

The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond. Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen, through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.

Sweet smells are some times used to cover foul ones.

With two eyes you can see my face. with three you could see my heart. With two you can see that oak tree there. With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become. With two you see no farther than your walls. Wit three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall.

### Your father listened, I have no doubt. But in the end, he decided for himself.

He had seldom seen such elegance and dignity in a whore. Though to bes sure, she saw herself more as a kind of priestess. Perhaps that is the secret.

### It is not what we do , so much as why we do it.

She told herself that there had been no time, but the truth was that food had lost its savor in a world without Ned.
The living should smile, for the dead cannot.

To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.

They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are. Pardoned them, yes. Forgiven, But not forgotten.

Why do you have them, if they serve no purpose?The mules love the sound of their own braying, why else? And I need them to haul my cart.

A different look , a different smell, a different way of walking, most men would be deceived.And most women, maybe. But not whores. A whore learns to see the man, not his garb, or she turns up dead in an alley.

### people often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it's served up.

## Battle Fever

How time seemed to blur and slow and even stop, how the past and the future vanished until there was nothing but the instant, how fear fled, and thought fled , and even your body. You don't feel your wounds then, or the sweat running down into your eyes. You stop feeling, you stop thinking , you stop being you, there is only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next, and you know they are afraid and tired but you are not, you're alive, and death is all around you but their swords move so slowly, you can dance through them laughing.
