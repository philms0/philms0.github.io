## Book Name: What Makes Your Brain Happy and Why You Should Do the Opposite

## Author: Di Salvo David

# Our brain want happy and certain

When what we're describing is complex and messy, our urge is to simplify the mess by imagining tidy categories, a tendency we call reductionism.

## Making sense is the best way of being certain

your brain is structured to make sense of stimuli and patterns in any environment you step into, and it's finding patterns in this new environment that overlay well with others you have experienced. Your brain is arriving at a determination that these patterns are familiar enough that you will be able to make reliable predictions about what is coming next in this environment.

### selective attention

also called "selectivity bias"- the tendency to orient oneself toward and process information from only one part of our environment to the exclusion of other parts, no matter how obvious those parts may be.

### Certainty and framing thinking

It operates in our minds like a script written by other people and colored by influences of which we're not even totally aware. Framing is, of course, also an external influence that affects us in the present. When framing blurs judgment, the nuts and bolts of the content matters far less, whether or not we realize it.

## We always seek evidence to confirm to be right

Your motivation in this case isn't to rationally evaluate the information you've found and, if necessary, change your position. Your real motivation is to find information that will confirm your existing position , because there's no way in hell that it's changing, period. We do this all the time with all sorts of beliefs and positions. What is it we're really after when we seek evidence to confirm, and dismiss or ignore evidence that dis-confirms? In a word: closure.
Even with something so trivial, confirmation bias is a tough force to overcome; both parties want the cerebral surge that comes with being proven right.

# Memories and self-awareness

We have to appreciate that our brains weren't born yesterday. We have mechanisms to warn of threats and guard against instability because they have worked for a very long time. We wouldn't be here without them . In the same way that any sane person feels apprehension about jumping out of an airplane , our brain puts the organism it controls on alert when danger looms- be it tangible or intangible. But we have to know when to override the alarm and take the less comfortable path anyway.
Our memories are wrong at least as often as they are right. At best, they are incomplete, though we might swear otherwise. This affects countless aspects of our lives, and in many cases our memories- true or false- affect others' lives

## We want meaning associations

The reason is that we assign a specific meaning to the placement (best, next best, worst), when it's possible that no such meaning exists . In fact, the Blu-ray player in the middle may be of no higher quality than the cheapest player . **Retail marketers know that people are convinced that their meaning associations are correct, and they leverage them to reap a higher markup on cheap items.** Our brains make these associations because that is what brains do (in part), and it's always helpful to remember that the adaptive capabilities of our brains-like pattern recognition- did not evolve to make sense of complex commercial environments like those we live in.
The human animal is the most formidable on the planet not only against other species but also against other humans. Not correctly identifying another's real intentions could very well be the last mistake a person makes.

## Why alcohol is bad

Research suggests that alcohol has the dual effect of causing our minds to wander while not noticing that we have zoned out, which is essentially an amplified version of our normal tendency to drift (and as we've seen, our brains really don't need any help going there).

## RPG and the indentifications

The formula for successful role-playing, in any form, is to empower participants to assume an identity as far removed from their day-to-day identities as they wish , and provide a dynamic, interactive world for them to explore. While the parameters of physical existence are all-too apparent, the new identity is beginning a virtually limitless existence.
The appeal of living, in effect, another life, one that consumes the same cranial space as the one that requires breathing air and drinking water, cannot be understated. And it should be noted that each of us comes equipped to "spin off " identities separate from the one consuming most of our waking hours, and these identities find a way to emerge, whether via role-playing or other experiences that fit the need. For example , the "you" who curses other drivers up and down the highway is probably not the "you" who behaves diplomatically at the office. In this sense, taking on new identities via media immersion in any form is not an extraordinary stretch for our brains; it just happens that some forms of immersion are more compelling than others.
humans can use technologies, like television, to feel a sense of belonging that they're lacking in their physical lives. And not only TV, but movies, music, and video games can fill this need as well, according to the theory.

### Loneliness the relationship and feelings

we live in an age of constant interaction, and yet more of us are claiming we're "lonely" than ever before. Loneliness, Cacioppo points out, has nothing to do with how many people are physically around us, but has everything to do with our failure to get what we need from our relationships.

## With others

The subjective evaluation we make when meeting someone new includes- to put it bluntly-what's in it for us. This interpretation is not nearly as cynical as it may seem. We are wired to evaluate others in large part on a trust basis , and to our brains, trust is linked to rewards. Both earning another's trust and feeling at ease enough to extend our trust are rewards in the parlance of the happy brain. It makes sense that our brains begin this evaluation from the first moment we make someone's acquaintance.
Another not-so-obvious aspect of first impressions is that the impression we are trying to give influences how we evaluate others. This seems to happen because when we focus on embellishing a particular trait in ourselves, we unconsciously increase the standard for that trait in others- and they usually fall short. So just because someone you're trying to impress doesn't seem as outgoing, gregarious, or confident as you are, don't assume that they truly aren't. It could be that how you are trying to come across has changed your perspective- your brain wouldn't have it any other way.
First, it tells us that we often use shaky criteria for making judgments about people. We determine that one stranger is more deserving of our trust than another either because we put unjustifiably high value on their like-mindedness, or we simply default to a stereotype. Neither of these tendencies speak especially well of themselves, though they evidence basic tendencies that are in all likelihood neutrally imprinted. In fact, neuroscience research has identified neural structures in our brains correlating to our social biases- so there is worthy evidence that social bias is, at least to some degree, wired into our noggins.
The truth is that our brains are not wired for complete independence. We are instead an exceptionally social species wired for interdependence. Ours is an existence of influence and counterinfluence-and none of us live on one-way streets.

# Education

## Two motivations for better excellence

when high achievers are primed to achieve excellence, the idea that a task is "fun" undercuts their desire to excel. If something is enjoyable and fun, how could it possibly be a credible gauge of achievement? Conversely, low achievers who are similarly primed with achievement words perceive a "fun" task as worthwhile. Not only is their motivation to perform improved, so is their ability.
This intriguing twist says much about why one-size-fits-all educational strategies so often fail. For students motivated to achieve excellence, making tasks entertaining may actually undermine their performance. Likewise, for those not normally motivated to achieve, describing a task as urgent and serious yields the predictable result.

## Rapid feedback is good

when feedback is rapid, the threat of disappointment increases. 4 The desire to avoid the dreary feeling you get when you fall short of expectations is a potent motivator to perform well.

## The irony of self-control

The result : The failure rate for those told they had high self-control was massively higher than for the low-self-control group, to the tune of 33 percent versus 11 percent. Those who thought themselves most able to resist temptation had to light up three times as much as those who suspected they'd fail.

## the power of wanting or the satisfaction of getting.

Many factors have been cited- and no doubt the reasons are not the same for all people- but the one consistently mentioned factor is that the allure of anticipating the win is immensely powerful. It is so powerful, in fact, that after focusing for days on winning an item and fighting off those who would nab the prize, bidders often feel an emotional letdown . They won the item, and in a few days it will arrive in the mail- excitement not included. As I am sure you have noticed, the three examples I just described share a central theme: the power of wanting trumps the satisfaction of getting.

### How to get out

Recent research suggests that we can "train" our brains to temper anticipation of reward without squashing it altogether (certain brain injuries can result in loss of anticipation of reward; it's not something most of us would want to lose). At the same time, psychology research indicates that when we're making decisions about what we want, focusing on experiences involving friends and family yields greater long-term rewards and far less regret than purchasing material items. The issue is more complicated for relationships, but solid research has shed light on this complex topic as well.
One of our brains' especially frustrating habits is to focus on getting a reward, and then experience a feeling of loss once we get it. This cycle can spin us into a loop of wanting, getting , and regretting. Awareness that you are caught in the cycle is paramount.

## Wherever you go, there you are -new place

It's common to believe that the new place or position will be significantly better than what we have become accustomed to. "Newness" has a sort of mystical draw , even though it's incredibly short-lived and rarely meets expectations (because those expectations are colored by an unattainable desire for ongoing elation). When we move to the new place and start the new position, the same cycle of regret sets in as anticipation of reward drifts off- hence the quirky but insightful axiom, "Wherever you go, there you are."

## The effect of Parents' action

When parents exhibit "disinhibited eating" (lack of control), but preach "dietary restraint" (strict control)- their kids get fatter.
Our brains are tuned to observe and re-create what we see in others, and this, like all habits of the happy brain, is both good and bad. On the upside, imitation plays a crucial role in learning. The downside is that imitation can spill over healthy boundaries and do us, and others, a world of harm. Two lessons come to mind. First, be careful about whose modeling is influencing you. Your brain has a difficult time distinguishing between good and bad lessons and will learn them with equal efficiency. Second, be careful about how you model for others. If you are a parent or guardian to young children, this lesson is especially important because kids' aptitude for imitation is exceptionally strong. Even when you think they aren't paying attention, you may be unknowingly modeling a behavior for them that you'll later regret.

# Other things to know

## cognitive fluency

that the more a message is repeated, the more likely we are to believe it-particularly if we are paying little attention. These studies suggest that we invest the most confidence in a message when it has been repeated three to five times. When we are saturated beyond that point, repetition loses its persuasiveness and may even reverse the effect altogether.

## How story changes your mind

Emotional involvement with narrative affects the way people think and supplies knowledge that may very well not be true.

## How experts make a difference

This result suggests that the taxi drivers' mastery can be generalized to new and unknown areas. Their years of training and learning through deliberate practice prepare them to take on similar challenges even in places they do not know well or at all.

## Sometimes bad , sometimes good always balanced

The moral deficiency (not recycling) is, in your view, balanced by a moral action (installing energy-efficient bulbs). The problem is that the seesaw can also tip the other way : If we believe we are doing enough, morally speaking, then there's little reason to do more. The scale is already level.
