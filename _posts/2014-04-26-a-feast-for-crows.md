# Shewolf- Sensa

_after murdering Lysa, Sensa and Littlefinger tried to ease the anger and rebellion of the lords of Alley. Littlefinger tried to teach Sansa to play the game(The same time the prince of Dorne was teaching his his daughter about the game)_

Men of honor will do things for their children that they would never consider doing for themselves.

what was best for Robert the boy and what was best for Lord Arryn were not always the same. Petyr had said as much, and it was true. Maester Colemon cares only for the boy, though. Father and I have larger concerns.

# Ironmen

_Both Asha and Victoria were failed to be the king of the iron throne, which was taken by Euro's Eye_

If I do not go, I will spend the rest of my life wondering what might have happened if I had." "If you do go, the rest of your life may be too short for wondering." "Better that than fill the remainder of my days complaining that the Seastone Chair by rights was mine. I am no Gwynesse."

# Lions-Jamie and Cersei

_Jamie went to Riverrun by his sister's command. during the journey, he learned much about himself, his sister and his family. While Cersei did lots of stupid things which finally made herself well known as the bitch queen._

Without his beard, Pycelle looked not only old, but feeble. Shaving him was the cruelest thing Tyrion could have done, thought Jaime, who knew what it was to lose a part of yourself, the part that made you who you were.

His sister liked to think of herself as Lord Tywin with teats, but she was wrong. Their father had been as relentless and implacable as a glacier, where Cersei was all wildfire, especially when thwarted. She had been giddy as a maiden when she learned that Stannis had abandoned Dragonstone, certain that he had finally given up the fight and sailed away to exile. When word came down from the north that he had turned up again at the Wall, her fury had been fearful to behold. She does not lack for wits, but she has no judgment, and no patience.

'You are my most able servant, Tywin,' the king said, 'but a man does not marry his heir to his servant's daughter.'

He glanced about the sept, at the gods. The Mother, full of mercy. The Father, stern in judgment. The Warrior, one hand upon his sword. The Stranger in the shadows, his half-human face concealed beneath a hooded mantle. I thought that I was the Warrior and Cersei was the Maid, but all the time she was the Stranger, hiding her true face from my gaze.

I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg, and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak . . . but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year. Men are such thundering great fools. Even the sort who come along once in a thousand years."

# Shewolf-Arya Stark

_Arya learned much in the temple, but she could never forget herself as a Stark. She took the wine and became blind after the man learned that she killed the deserter of the Night' Watch._

"All men lie when they are afraid. Some tell many lies, some but a few. Some have only one great lie they tell so often that they almost come to believe it though some small part of them will always know that it is still a lie, and that will show upon their faces.

You need only learn to read a face. Look at the eyes. The mouth The muscles here, at the corners of the jaw, and here, where the neck joins the shoulders." He touched her lightly with two fingers. "Some liars blink. Some stare. Some look away. Some lick their lips. Many cover their mouths just before they tell a lie, as if to hide their deceit. Other signs may be more subtle, but they are always there. A false smile and a true one may look alike, but they are as different as dusk from dawn. Can you tell dusk from dawn?" Arya nodded, though she was not certain that she could. "Then you can learn to see a lie . . . and once you do, no secret will be safe from you."

# The beauty of Tarth-Brienne

_With the oathkeeper given by Jamie, Brienne run around the kingdom to trace for Sensa Stark. However, she finally captured and hanged by Catelyn Stark, who was brought to life by the kiss of Beric and became the StoneWoman, the only purpose is then revenge._

"One god with seven aspects. That's so, my lady, and you are right to point it out, but the mystery of the Seven Who Are One is not easy for simple folk to grasp, and I am nothing if not simple, so I speak of seven gods."

As she lay dying, her worst curses were not for the men who had raped her, nor the monster who devoured her living flesh, but for Ser Quincy Cox, who barred his gates when the outlaws entered the town and sat safe behind stone walls as his people screamed and died." He could have tried, Brienne thought. He could have died. Old or young, a true knight is sworn to protect those who are weaker than himself, or die in the attempt.

"I know a little of this man, Sandor Clegane. He was Prince Joffrey's sworn shield for many a year, and even here we would hear tell of his deeds, both good and ill. If even half of what we heard was true, this was a bitter, tormented soul, a sinner who mocked both gods and men. He served, but found no pride in service. He fought, but took no joy in victory. He drank, to drown his pain in a sea of wine. He did not love, nor was he loved himself. It was hate that drove him. Though he committed many sins, he never sought forgiveness. Where other men dream of love, or wealth, or glory, this man Sandor Clegane dreamed of slaying his own brother, a sin so terrible it makes me shudder just to speak of it. Yet that was the bread that nourished him, the fuel that kept his fires burning. Ignoble as it was, the hope of seeing his brother's blood upon his blade was all this sad and angry creature lived for . . . and even that was taken from him, when Prince Oberyn of Dorne stabbed Ser Gregor with a poisoned spear." That was his warhorse, Stranger. A blasphemous name.

"It is being common-born that is dangerous, when the great lords play their game of thrones,"

# Fat Samwell

_Ameon got sick and died at Brovai where he met Arya, though the two of them didn't know each other. Sam finally reached OldTown with Gilly and Mance's son to bring the last words of Maester Ameon- that Dany was the choose one in the prophecy.And in Oldtown Sam would learn all the knowledge a Maester need. _

Even the most fanciful song may hold a kernel of truth.

What a man can do and what a man will do are two different things,

No mother loves all her children the same, not even the Mother Above.

_She knows the words you said. She is a child in some ways, but she is not blind. She knows why you wear the black, why you go to Oldtown. She knows she cannot keep you. She wants you for a little while, is all. She lost her father and her husband, her mother and her sisters, her home, her world. All she has is you, and the babe. So you go to her, or swim._
