**You can never know, you can only believe it or not**

结局他们能永远留在纳尼亚的原因是他们在伦敦的火车出事了，再也无法回到原来的世界中去。但是所有的kings and queens 中只有Susan无法回到纳尼亚中，因为她不再相信这些childish的东西，你不再相信它，你的世界里（或者你眼中的世界里）再也不会出现，即使它就在你身边。就像最后一部<the last battle>中那些在stable中的矮人，不愿意选择相信Aslan的存在，结局就是他们会自动把Aslan的东西用他们已有的知识进行合理化，永远也不愿意选择相信这是Aslan的存在 （you see ,they will not let us help them. They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison; and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out）

He also learned a great deal by using his own eyes and ears. As a little boy he had often wondered why he disliked his aunt, queen prunaprismia; he now saw that because she disliked him. 

Tirian had never dreamed that one of the results of an ape's setting up as a false Aslan would be to stop people from believing in the real one. 

I see now.This garden is like the stable. It is far bigger inside than it was outside. The further up and the further in you go, the bigger everything gets. The inside is larger than the outside.（你的层次越高，你的格局越大，你看到的东西就越多）

个人最喜欢的人物是Reechip，那只可以为了自己的信仰奋不顾身战斗的小老鼠,之后又因为没有尾巴而纠结，人物形象比较丰满.尤其是最后为了拯救那些lord甘愿独自去世界的尽头并永远留在那里,有一种荆轲刺秦的悲壮!

第二个就是那只类似青蛙的动物(Sorry forgot his name)。考虑问题永远从最坏出发，遇到困难却又是最坚定的。这种人永远是团队最需要的人-在大家被成功冲昏头脑的时候，提醒大家；在遇到危机大家都无能为力时挺身而出。

第三个就是Lucy，多数时候都是为别人考虑，对朋友和敌人都是mercy更多，勇敢却不失真实!
