## _George Leonard: Mastery The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment_

The master is the one who stays on the mat five minutes longer every day than anybody else.

### The Five Master Keys

Key 1: Instruction 55
Key 2: Practice 73
Key 3: Surrender 81
Key 4: Intentionality 89
Key 5: The Edge 97

### Surrender

The tricky part is learning to lose your ego without losing your balance. The stronger you are the more you can give of yourself. The more you give of yourself, the stronger you can be.

## _Stephen D Krashen: Principles and Practice in Second Language Acquisition(SLA)_

_Only after we understand the difference between acquisition and learning, then can we apply the following new process._

_ acquisition , Optimal input:Stage n+1 and affective filter_

# Five hypotheses about SLA

## 1. The acquisition-learning distinction

Acquisition is like the way children develop ability in their first language which are subconscious(it just "feels" right)
Learning means knowing the rules being aware of them ,error correction, conscious monitor.

## 2. The natural order hypothesis

The acquisition of grammatical structures proceeds in a predictable order(the order of acquisition for second language is not the same as the that for first language).

## 3. The Monitor hypothesis

Acquisition "initiates " our utterances in a second language and is responsible for our fluency.
Learning has only one function, and that is as a monitor or editor(which requires amounts of time, focus on the form and knowing the rule, it takes a real discrete-point grammar-type test to meet all three conditions for Monitor use and encourage significant use of the conscious grammar. ).

3 kinds of user
Monitor Over-user/under-user and the optimal Monitor user.

## 4. The input hypothesis

### (a) Statement of the hypothesis

The input hypothesis makes the following claim:
a necessary (but not sufficient) condition to move from stage i to stage i + 1 is that the acquirer understand input that contains i + 1, where "understand" means that the acquirer is focussed on the meaning and not the form of the message.
(1) The input hypothesis relates to acquisition, not learning.
(2) We acquire by understanding language that contains structure beyond our current level of competence (i + 1). This is done with the help of context or extra-linguistic information.
(3) When communication is successful, when the input is understood and there is enough of it, i + 1 will be provided automatically.
(4) Production ability emerges. It is not taught directly.

### (b) Evidence supporting the hypothesis

Why grammatical syllabus fails?
(1) All students may not be at the same stage. The "structure of the day" may not be i + 1 for many of the students. With natural communicative input, on the other hand, some i + 1 or other will be provided for everyone.
(2) With a grammatical syllabus, each structure is presented only once. If a student misses it, is absent, is not paying attention, or if there simply has not been enough practice (input), the student may have to wait until next year, when all structures are reviewed! On the other hand, roughly-tuned comprehensible input allows for natural review.
(3) A grammatical syllabus assumes we know the order of acquisition. No such assumption is necessary when we rely on comprehensible input, on roughly tuned natural communication.
(4) Finally, a grammatical syllabus, and the resulting grammatical focus, places serious constraints on what can be discussed. Too often, it is difficult, if not impossible, to discuss or read anything of real interest if our underlying motive is to practice a particular structure. In other words, a grammatical focus will usually prevent real communication using the second language.

## 5. The Affective Filter hypothesis

**(1) Motivation.**
Performers with high motivation generally do better in second language acquisition (usually, but not always, "integrative"13
**(2) Self-confidence.**
Performers with self-confidence and a good self-image tend to do better in second language acquisition.
**(3) Anxiety.**
Low anxiety appears to be conducive to second language acquisition, whether measured as personal or classroom anxiety.





**1. Acquisition is more important than learning.**
**2. In order to acquire, two conditions are necessary. The first is comprehensible (or even better, comprehended) input containing i + 1, structures a bit beyond the acquirer's current level, and second, a low or weak affective filter to allow the input "in".**

# The illusions of life

Anthe sitcoms and soaps, the crime shows, and MTV all run on the same hyped-up schedule:
(1) If you make smart-assed one-liners for a half hour, everything will work out fine in time for the closing commercials.
(2) People are quite nasty, don't work hard, and get rich quickly.
(3) No problem is so serious that it can't be resolved in the wink of an eye as soon as the gleaming barrel of a handgun appears.
(4) The weirdest fantasy you can think of can be realized instantly and without effort.
In all of this, the specific content isn't nearly as destructive to mastery as is the rhythm. One epiphany follows another. One fantasy is crowded out by the next. Climax is piled upon climax. There's no plateau.

### Silent period

It has often been noted that children acquiring a second language in a natural, informal linguistic environment may say very little for several months following their first exposure to the second language.
The explanation of the silent period in terms of the input hypothesis is straight-forward--the child is building up competence in the second language via listening, by understanding the language around him. In accordance with the input hypothesis, speaking ability emerges on its own after enough competence has been developed by listening and understanding.(class learning requires quick respond and provoke anxiety)
** (the silent period looks like the idea of plateau, where you struggle to use the skills just learned )**

# Practice is of importance

In our scriptures, it is said that there are four kinds of horses: excellent ones, good ones, poor ones, and bad ones. The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will1 before it sees the shadow of the whip; the second best will run as well as the first one, just before the whip reaches its skin; the third one will run when feels pain on its body; the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn to run.
When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. But this is a mistake. **When you learn too easily, you're tempted not to work hard, not to penetrate to the marrow of a practice.**
1f you study calligraphy, you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art, and in life. The best horse, according to Suzuki, may be the worst horse. Anthe worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever ills practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones.

# Which way will you choose?

You realize that you have a decision to make at some point along the journey, if not now. You're tempted drop tennis and go out looking for another, easier sport. Or you might try twice as hard, insist on extra lessons, practice day and night. Or you could quit your lessons and take whatever You've learned out on the court; you could forget about improving your game and just have fun with friends who don't play much better than you. Of course, you could also do what your teachers suggests, and stay on the long road to mastery. What will you choose?
This question, this moment of choice, comes up countless times in each of our lives, not just about tennis or some other sport, but about everything that has to do with learning, development, change. Sometimes we choose after careful deliberation, but frequently the choice is careless-barely conscious one. Seduced by the siren song of a consumerist, quick-fix society, we sometimes choose a course of action that brings only the illusion of accomplishment, the shadow of satisfaction. And sometimes, knowing little or nothing about the process that Leads to mastery, we don't even realize a choice is being offered. Yet even our failures to choose consciously operate as choices, adding to or subtracting from the amount of our potential that we will eventually realize.
