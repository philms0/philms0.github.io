_To him who looks upon the world rationally, the world in turn presents a rational aspect. The relation is mutual.-George W. F. Hegel_

# Basics: Geopolitics

Geopolitics assumes two things. First, it assumes that humans organize themselves into units larger than families, and that by doing this, they must engage in politics. It also assumes that humans have a natural loyalty to the things they were born into, the people and the places. Loyalty to a tribe, acity, or a nation is natural to people. In our time, national identity matters a great deal. Geopolitics teaches that the relationship between these nations is a vital dimension of human life, and that means that war is ubiquitous.
Second, geopolitics assumes that the character of a nation is determined to a great extent by geography, as is the relationship between nations. We use the term geography broadly. It includes the physical characteristics of a location, but it goes beyond that to look at the effects of a place on individuals and communities.

## China- the next challenger ?

There are many who predict that China is the next challenger to the United States, not Russia. I don't agree with that view for three reasons.
First, when you look at a map of China closely, you see that it is really a very isolated country physically. With Siberia in the north, the Himalayas and jungles to the south, and most of China's population in the eastern part of the country, the Chinese aren't going to easily expand.
Second, China has not been a major naval power for centuries, and building a navy requires a long time not only to build ships but to create well-trained and experienced sailors.
Third, there is a deeper reason for not worrying about China. China is inherently unstable. Whenever it opens its borders to the outside world, the coastal region becomes prosperous, but the vast majority of Chinese in the interior remain impoverished. This leads to tension, conflict, and instability.
It also leads to economic decisions made for political reasons, resulting in inefficiency and corruption. This is not the first time that China has opened itself to foreign trade, and it will not be the last time that it becomes unstable as a result. Nor will it be the last time that a figure like Mao emerges to close the country off from the outside, equalize the wealth-or poverty-and begin the cycle anew. There are some who believe that the trends of the last thirty years will continue indefinitely. I believe the Chinese cycle will move to its next and inevitable phase in the coming decade. Far from being a challenger, China is a country the United States will be trying to bolster and hold together as a counterweight to the Russians. Current Chinese economic dynamism does not translate into long- term success.

## Irony of Europe - unable to unite

**_due to English Channel_**

Here is the irony: Europe dominated the world, but it failed to dominate itself. For five hundred years Europe tore itself apart in civil wars, and as a result there was never a European empire-there was instead a British empire, a Spanish empire, a French empire, a Portuguese empire, and so on.
The European nations exhausted themselves in endless wars with each other while they invaded, subjugated, and eventually ruled much of the world.
There were many reasons for the inability of the Europeans to unite, but in the end it came down to a simple feature of geography: the English Channel. First the Spanish, then the French, and finally the Germans managed to dominate the European continent, but none of them could cross the Channel. Because no one could defeat Britain, conqueror after conqueror failed to hold Europe as a whole.

#  American power

## Cold war immaturity -Strong but not confident

It is interesting to note that throughout the Cold War, the United States was on the defensive psychologically. Korea, McCarthyism, Cuba, Vietnam, Sputnik, left- wing terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, and harsh criticism of Reagan by European allies all created a constant sense of gloom and uncertainty in America. Atmospherics gave the United States the continual sense that its advantage in the Cold War was slipping away. Yet underneath the hood, in the objective reality of power relations, the Russians never had a chance. This disjuncture between the American psyche and geopolitical reality is important to remember for two reasons. First, it reveals the immaturity of American power. Second, it reveals a tremendous strength. Because the United States was insecure, it generated a level of effort and energy that was overwhelming. There was nothing casual or confident in the way the Americans-from political leaders to engineers to military and intelligence officers-waged the Cold War.

## US control the world after World War II

The fact that the United States emerged from World War II not only with the world's largest navy but also with naval bases scattered around the world changed the way the world worked. As I mentioned previously, any seagoing vessel-commercial or military, from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea to the Caribbean-could be monitored by the United StatesNavy, who could choose to watch it, stop it, or sink it. From the end of World War II onward, the combined weight of all of the world's existing fleets was insignificant compared to American naval power.
This highlights the single most important geopolitical fact in the world:
the United States controls all of the oceans. No other power in history has been able to do this. And that control is not only the foundation of America's security but also the foundation of its ability to shape the international system.
having control of the seas gave the United States a huge political advantage as well. America could not be invaded, but it could invade other countries-whenever and however it chose.

## The strategy of America

The foregoing allows us to understand the American response to the Islamist attacks and much else that has happened. Having systematically achieved its strategic goals, the United States had the ultimate aim of preventing the emergence of any major power in Eurasia. The paradox, however, is as follows: the goal of these interventions was never to achieve something-whatever the political rhetoric might have said-but to prevent something. The United States wanted to prevent stability in areas where another power might emerge. Its goal was not to stabilize, but to destabilize. And that explains how the United States responded to the Islamic earthquake-it wanted to prevent a large, powerful Islamic state from emerging.

# Birthrate and the world's population

Let's start simply. Between about 1750 and 1950, the world's population grew from about one billion people to about three billion. Between 1950 and2000, it doubled, from three billion to six billion. Not only was the population of the world growing, but the growth was accelerating at an amazing rate. If that trajectory had continued, the result would have been global catastrophe.
But the growth rate has not accelerated. It has actually slowed down dramatically.
According to the United Nations, between 2000 and 2050 the population will continue to grow, but only by about 50 percent, halving the growth rate of the previous fifty years. In the second half of the century, it becomes more interesting. Again, the population will continue to grow, but only by 10 percent statistically, according to other forecasters. This is like slamming on the brakes. In fact, some forecasts （not by the UN） have indicated that the total human population will decline by 2100.
Let's examine a critical number: 2.1. This is the number of children that each woman must have, on average, in order to maintain a generally stable world population.

## population crisis of America

The United States is socially imitated and politically condemned. It sits on the ideological fault line of the international system. As populations decline due to shifts in reproductive patterns, the United States becomes the center for radically redefined modes of social life. You can't have a modern economy without computers and corporations, and if you are going to program computers, you need to know English, the language of computing. On one hand, those who want to resist this trend must actively avoid the American model of life and thought. On the other hand, those who don't adopt America's ways can't have a modern economy. This is what gives America its strength and continually frustrates its critics. Falling populations are restructuring the pattern of families and daily lives. Computers are transforming, simplifying, and focusing the way people think. Corporations are constantly reorganizing the way we work. Between these three factors, love, reason, and daily life are being transformed, and through that transformation American power is growing.
Old institutions have shattered, but new ones have not yet emerged. TheP128We can already see the leading edge of this crisis today in the graying of the population of advanced industrialized countries. Part of the crisis will be social-the family structures that have been in place for centuries will continue to break down, leaving larger numbers of elderly people with no one to care for them. And as I stated earlier, there will be more and more elderly people to care for. This will create intense political struggle between social conservatism and ever- changing social reality. We are already seeing this in popular culture-from talk shows to politicians-but it will intensify dramatically until a crisis point is reached in the mid-2020s.
The crisis will come to a head, if history is any guide, in the presidential election of either 2028 or 2032. I say that because there is an odd-and not entirely explicable-pattern built into American history. Every fifty years, roughly, the United States has been confronted with a defining economic and social crisis. The problem emerges in the decade before the crisis becomes apparent. A pivotal presidential election is held that changes the country's political landscape over the following decade or so. The crisis is resolved, and the United States flourishes. Over the next generation, the solution to the old problem generates a new one, which intensifies until there is another crisis and the process repeats itself. Sometimes the defining moment is not readily apparent until later, and sometimes it can't be missed.
But it is always there.

# Policy of US against Japan and Turkey

The American response will be a policy it has executed numerous times in history-it will squeeze each of the powers economically. Both countries will depend to some extent on exports, difficult in a world where populations will no longer be growing very fast. The United States will begin forming an economic bloc that will bestow most-favored-nation status on exports into the United States for countries that are prepared to shift their purchases away from Turkey and Japan and toward third countries-not even necessarily the United States-that could supply the same goods. In other words, the United States will organize a not particularly subtle boycott of Japanese and Turkish goods.
In addition, the United States will start limiting the export of technology to both of these countries. Given the American work being done in robotics and genetics, this will hurt Turkish and Japanese high- tech capabilities.
Most important, there will be a surge in U.S. military aid to China, India, and Poland, as well as to forces resisting Turkey and Japan in Russia.
American policy will be simple: to create as many problems as possible for these two countries in order to deter them from forming a coalition.

# Others

The United States will have learned over the past fifty years that the devastation of the enemy, no matter how satisfying, is not the best strategy. Its goal will be to maintain the balance of power, to keep regional powers focused on each other and not the United States.

One interesting facet of geopolitics is this: there are no permanent solutions to geopolitical problems.

In addition, a crucial geopolitical principle will be tested, and modernized: whoever controls the Atlantic and Pacific oceans will control global trade-and whoever controls space will control the world's oceans. The United States will emerge in unchallenged control of space, and therefore in control of the world's oceans.

The solution to one problem will be the catalyst for the next one.

This tremendous inequality is exactly what you would expect to see in a country in the process of rapid development

## Technology VS labor

Technology has frequently promised to eliminate jobs. The exact opposite as always happened. More jobs have been created in order to maintain the technology. What has happened is a shift from unskilled to skilled labor.
That will certainly be one result of robotics. Someone will have to design and maintain the systems. But robotics differs from all prior technologies in a fundamental way. Prior technologies have had labor displacement as a byproduct.
Robotics is designed explicitly for labor displacement. The entire point of this class of technology is replacing scarce human labor with cheaper technology. The first goal will be replacing labor that is no longer available. The second will be to shift available labor to support robotics. The third-and this is where the problem starts-will be the direct displacement of workers. In other words, while robotics will be designed to replace disappearing workers, it will also create unemployment among workers who are displaced but don't have the skills to move into robotics.
