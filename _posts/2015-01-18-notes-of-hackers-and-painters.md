## _**hackers and painters **_by **Paul Graham**

# Views and Comments

Many things we take for granted are in fact not insoluble after all. So always thinks about the things in the daily life that makes you puzzled. Maybe you'll find things unexpected

I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true.

P45 The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want.

P73 In fact you gain, because he is one more user helping to make your software the standard-or who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school.(Microsoft adobe).When they can, companies like to do something called price discrimination, which means charging each customer as much as they can afford.9 Software is particularly suitable for price discrimination, because the marginal cost is close to zero.

P81 You can so you must!(so that you can win in the compete )

Money is not wealth, money is created because of specialization, if you want to make money ,just make something that people want .

Always choose the harder one because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.

P110 wealth is (except for a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have to create, not something that's distributed by Daddy, when wealth is something you're given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally

P116 Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people. They lived in houses full of ser- vants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and servants. Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. But what label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus not having it.

P118 I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If we don't see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.

P159 I can already tell you what's going to happen to all those extra cycles that faster hardware is going to give us in the next hundred years. They're nearly all going to be wasted.

# People & Society

P3 In fact, most people who "can draw" like drawing, and have spent many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, popular isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make yourself.

P6 Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks.

P20 why people judge hackers and scientists by publications is that is easy to apply this tests.

P31 Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people, for example, because people are what people are interested in.

P33 Over and over we see the same pattern. A new medium ap- pears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple generations.

P37 When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that's a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement as "divisive" or "racially insensitive" instead of arguing that it's false, we should start paying attention.

P48 It is the nature of fashion to be invisible

P54 Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak.

P55 They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are the source of America's wealth and power.

P60 When people lose their own data in a disk crash, they can't get that mad, because they only have them- selves to be mad at. When a company loses their data for them, they'll get a lot madder.

P76 There is always a tendency for rich customers to buy expensive solutions, even when cheap solutions are better, because the people offering expensive solutions can spend more to sell them.

What makes a good design. Taste is not subjective, if not why Leonardo Da Vinci makes the greatest paintings, why man think some kind women is more sexy?

# Work&Study

P19 You're asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without understanding how to do it.

P25 it means you have one kind of work you do for money, and another for love.

A good way to learn is from copying the examples for copying forces you to look closely at the way how it is made

P30 As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts. It was common for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants to paint the others and the background. But you never had one guy painting over the work of another. I think this is the right model for collaboration in software too. Don't push it too far. When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.

It turns out that looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success.

P101 Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.

P96 You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can.

P112 It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could re- ally generate so much more wealth than another. The key to this mystery is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us? Would a basketball team trade one of their players for 100 random people? What would Apple's next product look like if you replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? These things don't scale linearly. Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and determination of an ordinary person. But it makes all the difference that it's concentrated in one individual. To say that a certain kind of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong things.

P137 Perhaps what practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought.

# Programming

Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

P78 desktop computers won because start-ups wrote software for them.

Good design is simple, is timeless, it solve the right problem, it is suggestive, is often slightly funny. Good design is also hard but looks easy, it uses symmetry and resembles the nature .Good design is redesign.

P145 The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.

P160 Since speed doesn't matter in most of a program, you won't ordinarily need to bother with this sort of micromanagement. This will be more and more true as computers get faster.

P161 . Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time.

P183 The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages are equivalent is that it's not true. But the advantage is that it makes your life a lot simpler. And I think that's the main reason the idea is so widespread. It is a comfortable idea.

That's because software is expensive. To build and maintain the best software requires engineering and design talent that will only stick around when a company has an obvious way to make money.
