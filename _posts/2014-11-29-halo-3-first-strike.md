## synopsis

_John-the Master Chief-Spartan -097 destroy the Flood on Halo(Halo 2:The Flood), then successfully onboard a UNSC ship to Reach-where his Spartan team members had been. There they meet the Blue Team ,Dr. Halsey and Admiral Whitcomb Alamo, they also get a crystal that can speed up the transition in slipspace about 10 times, which is the reason the Covenants attack Reach. During the battle, with the help of Cortana, they also obtain the massage that the Covenant have located the position of Earth and the rendezvous of the Covenant armada. They got only one choice: they have to alarm the Earth ASAP and undermine the rendezvous-which is the **first Strike** ._

### How life and experience changes people.

As a professional soldier, John was ready to give up anything for victory-his personal comfort, his friends, his own life if that's it took-but he'd never considered that he'd have to scarifice his dignity and pride as well for the greater good.P93

## P141 Fred on Reach

He didn't want to think about them-but he couldn't help it.Maybe it was the darkness and the constant weight of the earth around him.

What if they died here? Not died fighting, but just died here. In a way, that wouldn't be so bad. Fred had faced death a dozen times, brushed so close to it he had stared it in the face until it blinked and turned away.

**This was different, though. He didn't want to die, not without knowing if the other Spartans were still out there fighting. Not if they still needed him.**

## P129-Half truth is the best lie

Kalmiya(_Same AI like Cortana_) would undoubtedly stress-analyze her vocal patterns,so she told her the truth. It was always a game of chess with smart AIs-move and countermove. It was a constant challenge to earn and keep their respect. That's why she preferred their company to humans-they were so deliciously complex. **Yes, she told her the truth... just not the whole truth. (Dr. Halsey)**

## P151 the contradiction of death

"Don't you worry about her," Johnson said. "Hell, I been hit worse and she's three times the soldier I am. She'll pull through."

The Chief sealed the hatch without comment. He had heard the same hollow promises a hundred times before with critically wounded men. **Why was it that soldiers would face their own deaths without blinking an eye... but when faced with the death of a squadmate, they turned away and lied to themselves?**

## P192 ( when John see Dr. Halsey at Reach)

For a heartbeat the Master Chief forgot that he was in the heart of an enemy's camp; he forgot about the war, that Reach had fallen, and everything else he had gone through in the last few days. He had never thought he would see her again.

## P204 (The magic of the crystal)

For a moment he thought the crystal she had brought with her had shattered. But it hadn't broken, not exactly. The top half of the slender shard had split along its facets and opened like a flower blossom. The sapphire petals undulated, and as the ultraviolet light of the grav beam fell upon them, the crystal opened wider. The facets twirled and spun in a complex geometric dance. The crystal seemed to reshape itself, and it pulsed a cool green.The light inside the ship cleared-all traces of the purple tint seemed to recede like a tide. The dropship lurched upward.

## P230 the old axiom of command

Admiral Whitcomb sighed. He felt for the Spartan... felt too much-which was the problem. He couldn't concentrate with her so close. He'd want constant status reports on her condition. Hell, he would have gone over, knelt next to her, and held her hand if that would've helped. He loved the men and women under his command as if they were his own sons and daughters.** It was the old axiom of command: To be a good leader, you had to love the service. To be a great commander, you had to be willing to destroy that which you loved.**

# One person VS the whole world

P245
**For a long time I had thought that we had to sacrifice a few for the good of the entire human race. But now I'm not sure that philosophy has worked out too well. I should have been trying to save every single human life-no matter what it cost**.(Before Dr. Halsey left The Chief)

P331
Now listen, son, remember when we talked about the Alamo? You know every one of the brave defenders in those fights died. They knew the odds, but they hurt the enemy." He gritted his teeth in pain. "Both were tactical defeats, but in the end they were also brilliant strategic victories. They made the enemy afraid. Just a few good soldiers fighting for what's right made the difference."

(Admiral Whitcomb Alamo use a fake crystal(holly to the Covenants ) to keep the Covenant in the trap Master Chief set, which a blast would destroy the flotilla as well as the Unyielding Hierophant(the ship Alamo on) )

Now, John knew the difference one man could make in this war. He understood Dr. Halsey's desire to save every person she could.

That was the point, wasn't it?** He couldn't know the future. He had to do what he could to save every person. Today. Now.**
