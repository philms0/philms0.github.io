# GAME of thrones

## When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.

There is not middle ground.(_Men grow and men die._)

He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. You knew the man, the king is a stranger to you.(_That's why power can change a man._)

They hate you because you act like you are better than they are.(_and because they think they are same as you._)

Let them see that their words can cut you, and you'll never be free of the mockery. If they want give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can't hurt you with it anymore.(_How to treat a mockery_)

## Watching is not seeing

, dead girl. The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said 'her,' and that is what the others saw. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears...Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.(_Look with your eyes, think with your mind not your desire._)

That was the trouble with the clans; they had an absurd notion that every man's voice should be heard in council, so they argued about everything, endlessly. Small wonder that they had been hundreds of years since thy last threatened the Vale with anything beyond an occasional raid.(_The irony of democracy and equality?_)

The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer. **If that's true, why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when you high lords play your game of thrones?** ([_Lords plays while peasants hurt._]https://philms.today/2014/04/19/war-in-common-persons-eye))

Always follow a big man into battle. They make such splendid targets.He will draw they eyes of every bowman on the field.(_A trick in battle ^_^_)

# About man

Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be given up.(_All I know is that Duke Edward give up the kingdom._)

A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought is to run around or knock it down. A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot. (_That's how a man grows._)

### "Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?" his father's voice replied to him, "That is the only time a man can be brave."

(_If you are not afraid, how can you be brave_)

Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it. The world was full of cravens who pretended to admit to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.(_Mr. Martin tell it true, we are pretend to ..._)

## the price of honor

The men who formed the Night's Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north. They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve. So they vowed they would have not wives nor children. The Night's Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded.

There's much to be said for taking people unawares. You never know what you might learn.(_Maybe you will learn the bitter truth._)

# About life

## We shall see what we shall see.

**You see what you expect to see, and ignore the others. You can only see the things you have the ability to see and the things other people let you see.**
(_I like this phrase the best, that's why I choose it as slogan for my photography._ )

### A man who won't listen can't hear.

(_Are you listen or pretend to listen?_)

Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.(_the reason why we should live._)

No one mocked him in his bedchamber, but he would not live his life in his bed.(_when Bran choose to go outside._)

As the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her.(_Joy always after the suffering._)
