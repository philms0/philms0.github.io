## Book Name: Willpower - Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength

**_The key to succeed: set a goal, stick with it, keep track and keep improving._**

# Something About Willpower

**Willpower are used for the control of thoughts, emotions, and for impulse control, performance control. And Self-control will make one's life much successful and better.**
The effort to control their emotional reactions(either suppressing their feelings or venting their grief) depleted their willpower. Faking it didn't come free.
**_To promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing._**

## Addictions

If you're trying to resist temptation, you may find yourself feeling the forbidden desires more strongly just when your ability to resist them is down. Ego depletion thus creates a double whammy: Y**our willpower is diminished and your cravings feel stronger than ever.**
The problem can be particularly acute for people struggling with addiction. Researchers have long noticed that cravings are especially strong during withdrawal. More recently they've noticed that lots of other feelings intensify during withdrawal. During withdrawal, the recovering addict is using so much willpower to break the habit that it's likely to be a time of intense, prolonged ego depletion, and that very state will make the person feel the desire for the drug all the more strongly. Moreover, other events will also have an unusually strong impact, causing extra distress and creating further yearnings for the cigarette or drink or drug. It's no wonder relapses are so common and addicts feel so weird when they quit.

## You should know

**1. You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. **
**2. You use the same stock of willpower for all manner of tasks.**

You use the same supply of willpower to deal with frustrating traffic, tempting food, annoying colleagues, demanding bosses, pouting children. Resisting dessert at lunch leaves you with less willpower to praise your boss's awful haircut. The old line about the frustrated worker going home and kicking the dog jibes with the ego-depletion experiments, although modern workers generally aren't so mean to their pets. They're more likely to say something nasty to the humans in the household.

## Advice: One Goal Each Time

But before we get into specific advice, we can offer one general bit of guidance based on the ego-depletion studies, and it's the same approach taken by Amanda Palmer: Focus on one project at a time. If you set more than one self-improvement goal, you may succeed for a while by drawing on reserves to power through, but that just leaves you more depleted and more prone to serious mistakes later.

# Plans matters

The superior students not only emphasized distal goals but were also more likely than the lesser students to see their current studies and work as vital steps leading toward those goals. Another reason is that older children are better able than younger ones to think about the future.
A year after the program ended, the monthly planners were still getting better grades than the daily planners, most of whom by this point had largely abandoned planning, daily or otherwise.
Why? Daily plans do have the advantage of letting the person know exactly what he or she should be doing at each moment. But their preparation is time-consuming, because it takes much longer to make thirty daily plans than a broad plan for the month without any daily details. Another drawback of daily plans is that they lack flexibility. They deprive the person of the chance to make choices along the way, so the person feels locked into a rigid and grinding sequence of tasks. Life rarely goes exactly according to plan, and so the daily plans can be demoralizing as soon as you fall off schedule. With a monthly plan, you can make adjustments. If a delay arises one day, your plan is still intact.

## The Zeigarnik Effect

**Uncompleted tasks and unmet goals tend to pop into one's mind**. Once the task is completed and the goal reached, however, this stream of reminders comes to a stop.(_One demonstration of this effect is listen to a song and shut off it halfway. The song is then likely to run through your mind on its own, the mind treats the song as unfinished business. As if to keep reminding you that there is a job to be done, the mind keeps inserting bits of the song into your stream of thought. We're more likely to turn off the bad one in midsong._)
Even though they hadn't finished the task or made any palpable progress,** the simple act of making a plan had cleared their minds and eliminated the Zeigarnik effect**. But the Zeigarnik effect remained for the students without a plan. Their thoughts wandered from the novel to their undone tasks, and afterward they scored worse on the comprehension test. So it turns out that the Zeigarnik effect is not, as was assumed for decades, a reminder that continues unabated until the task gets done.(**_That's why Mr. Allen recommend writing all things down._**)

# Making Decision

**_(A good recommendation or default option is always helpful in decision making, especially when people are ego-depletion.)_**
"When we're trying to decide what to do with our stuff or what movie to see," Allen says, "we don't think to ourselves, Look at all these cool choices. There's a powerful thing inside that says, If I decide to do that movie, I kill all the other movies. **You can pretend all the way up to that point that you know the right thing to do, but once you're faced with a choice, you have to deal with this open loop in your head: You're wrong, you're right, you're wrong, you're right. Every single time you make a choice, you're stepping into an existential void.**"
The link between willpower and decision making works both ways: **_Decision making depletes your willpower, and once your willpower is depleted, you're less able to make decisions_**. If your work requires you to make hard decisions all day long, at some point you're going to be depleted and start looking for ways to conserve energy. You'll look for excuses to avoid or postpone decisions. You'll look for the easiest and safest option, which often is to stick with the status quo: Leave the prisoner in prison.

## Why Cannot Settle Down

"When you have all these criteria to consider, and so many people to choose from, you start striving for perfection," he says. "You don't want to settle for someone who's not ideal in height, age, religion, and forty-five other dimensions."
"Closing a door on an option is experienced as a loss, and people are willing to pay a price to avoid the emotion of loss," Ariely says. Sometimes that makes sense,** but too often we're so eager to keep options open that we don't see the long-term price that we're paying-or that others are paying**. When you won't settle for less than a perfect mate, you end up with no one. When parents can never say no to projects at the office, their children suffer at home. When a judge can't bring himself to make a hard decision about parole, he's quite literally closing the door on the prisoner's cell.

## The Tricks of Salesperson

As they started picking features, customers would carefully weigh the choices, but as decision fatigue set in they'd start settling for whatever the default option was. And the more tough choices they encountered early in the process-like going through those fifty-six colors to choose the precise shade of gray or brown for the sedan's interior- the quicker people got fatigued and settled for the path of least resistance by taking the default option.(**Once decision fatigue set in, people tended to settle for the recommended option.** ) By manipulating the order of the car buyers' choices, the researchers found that the customers would end up settling for different kinds of options, and the average difference totaled more than fifteen hundred euros per car.

## Get Rid of Hot Women When Making Decision

**Men who saw photos of hot women shifted toward getting an immediate reward instead of waiting for a larger payoff in the future**. Apparently, the sight of an attractive woman makes men want cash right away. They focus on the present rather than the future. This effect is probably deeply rooted in the psyche and in the evolutionary past. Modern DNA research has revealed that most men in the past did not leave a line of descendants-their odds of reproducing were only half as high as the typical woman's.

# Self-monitoring

When people were placed in front of a mirror, or told that their actions were being filmed, they consistently changed their behavior. These self-conscious people worked harder at laboratory tasks. They gave more valid answers to questionnaires. Whenever people focused on themselves, they seemed to compare what they saw with some sort of idea of what they should be like. Self-awareness always seemed to involve comparing the self to these ideas of what one might, or should, or could, be. Self-awareness involves a process of comparing yourself to standards.
People can make themselves feel good by comparing themselves to the "average person"-who we all like to think is inferior to ourselves. We also can often get pleasure by comparing our current selves to our past selves, because we generally think we're improving.** Self-awareness evolved because it helps self-regulation**.
**Keeping track is more than just knowing where things are. It means knowing where things are in relation to where they should be.** Our ancestors lived in groups that rewarded members for living up to the common values, norms, and ideals. Therefore, people who could adjust their actions to meet those standards fared better than the ones who were oblivious to their own social faux pas.

# Practice and Training Make a Difference

"That's where the training comes in," he said. "It gives you the confidence to pull through a situation that isn't so easy."
"Getting your brain wired into little goals and achieving them, that helps you achieve the bigger things you shouldn't be able to do," he said. "It's not just practicing the specific thing. It's always making things more difficult than they should be, and never falling short, so that you have that extra reserve, that tank, so you know you can always go further than your goal. For me that's what discipline is. It's repetition and practice."
exercise increased people's stamina, allowing them to hold out against temptations even when their mental resources had been depleted.
I always presented as decent an appearance as possible, both for self-discipline and for self-respect. -Stanley

## Precommitment.

The essence of this strategy is to lock yourself into a virtuous path. You recognize that you'll face terrible temptations to stray from the path, and that your willpower will weaken. So you make it impossible-or somehow unthinkably disgraceful or sinful-to leave the path.

## Good Habits make life easier

The behaviors they had coded as automatic tended to be linked to habits, whereas the more controlled sorts of behaviors tended to be unusual or one-time-only actions. Self-control turned out to be most effective when people used it to establish good habits and break bad ones. People with self-control were more likely to regularly use condoms, and to avoid habits like smoking, frequent snacking, and heavy drinking. It took willpower to establish patterns of healthy behavior-which was why the people with more willpower were better able to do it-but o**nce the habits were established, life could proceed smoothly, particularly some aspects of lif**e.
When Boice followed up on the group some years later, he found that their paths had diverged sharply. The page-a-day folks had done well and generally gotten tenure. The so-called "binge writers" fared far less well, and many had had their careers cut short. The clear implication was that the best advice for young writers and aspiring professors is: **Write every day. Use your self-control to form a daily habit, and you'll produce more with less effort in the long run.**

## Thinking in High-level Terms

For instance, people were asked to reflect either on why they did something or on how they did something. "Why" questions push the mind up to higher levels of thinking and a focus on the future. "How" questions bring the mind down to low levels of thinking and a focus on the present. Another procedure that produced similar results was to have people move up or down from a given concept, like the word singer. To induce a high-level mind-set, people were asked, "A singer is an example of what?" In contrast, to induce a low-level mind-set, they were asked, "What is an example of a singer?" Thus the answer pushed them to think either more globally or more specifically. **These manipulations of mental state had no inherent relation to self-control. Yet self-control improved among people who were encouraged to think in high-level terms, and got worse among those who thought in low-level terms.**

## The Benefit of Religions

Religion promotes family values and social harmony, in part because some values gain in importance by being supposedly linked to God's will or other religious values. Less obvious benefits included the finding that religion reduces people's inner conflicts among different goals and values. As we noted earlier, conflicting goals impede self-regulation, so it appears that religion reduces such problems by providing believers with clearer priorities. More important, religion affects two central mechanisms for self-control: building willpower and improving monitoring.

# The Education of Kids: About Punishment

Whether you're giving a time-out to a toddler or revoking a teenager's driving privileges, there are three basic facets of punishment: **severity, speed, and consistency**. Many people associate strict discipline with severe penalties, but that's actually the least important facet. Researchers have found that severity seems to matter remarkably little and can even be counterproductive: Instead of encouraging virtue, harsh punishments teach the child that life is cruel and that aggression is appropriate. The speed of the punishment is much more important, as researchers have found in working with children as well as with animals. For lab rats to learn from their mistakes, the punishment generally has to occur almost immediately, preferably within a second of the misbehavior. Punishment doesn't have to be that quick with children, but the longer the delay, the more chance that they'll have forgotten the infraction and the mental processes that led to it.
By far the **_most important facet of punishment-and the most difficult one for parents-is consistency._** Ideally, a parent should quickly discipline the child every single time he or she misbehaves, but in a restrained, even mild manner. A stern word or two is often enough as long as it's done carefully and regularly. This approach can initially be more of a strain on the parents than on the child. They're tempted to overlook or forgive some misdeed, if only because they're tired or because it may spoil the pleasant time everyone else is having. Parents may rationalize that they want to be kind; they may even tell each other to be nice and let this one go. But the more vigilant they are early on, the less effort is required in the long run. Consistent discipline tends to produce well-behaved children.
When parents are inconsistent, when they let an infraction slide, they sometimes try to compensate with an extra-strict punishment for the next one. This requires less self-control on the parents' part: They can be nice when they feel like it, and then punish severely if they're feeling angry or the misbehavior is egregious. But imagine how this looks from the child's point of view. Some days you make a smart remark and the grown-ups all laugh. Other days a similar remark brings a smack or the loss of treasured privileges. Seemingly tiny or even random differences in your own behavior or in the situation seem to spell the difference between no punishment at all and a highly upsetting one. Besides resenting the unfairness, you learn that the most important thing is not how you behave but whether or not you get caught, and whether your parents are in the mood to punish. You might learn, for instance, that table manners can be dispensed with at restaurants, because the grown-ups are too embarrassed to discipline you in public. "Parents find it hard to administer discipline in public because they feel judged," Carroll says. "They're afraid people will think they're a bad mother. But you have to get that out of your head. I've had people stare at me when I take a child out of a restaurant for being rude, but you can't worry about that. You have to do what's right for the child, and it really is all about being consistent. They have to grow up knowing what's appropriate and inappropriate behavior."

# The Virtue of Procrastination

The result suggests that telling yourself I can have this later operates in the mind a bit like having it now. It satisfies the craving to some degree-and can be even more effective at suppressing the appetite than actually eating the treat. Procrastination is usually a vice, but occasionally-very occasionally-there is such a thing as positive procrastination. In the previous chapter we discussed experiments showing that people tempted by chocolate managed to avoid it by telling themselves they'd eat it some other time-a postponement strategy that worked better than trying to deny themselves altogether. This "I'll have it later" trick can work for other temptations, too. If a TV show is keeping you from getting back to work, record it and tell yourself you'll finish watching it later. You might discover, once you've finished work and don't need an excuse to procrastinate, that you don't really want to watch the show after all. Vice delayed may turn out to be vice denied.

# The last Thing

**_Use Willpower to Avoid Problems Rather Than to Deal with Problems_**
****
Yes, temptations are getting more sophisticated, but so are the tools for resisting them. The benefits of willpower are appreciated more clearly than ever. You could sum up a large new body of research literature with a simple rule: The best way to reduce stress in your life is to stop screwing up. That means setting up your life so that you have a realistic chance to succeed. Successful people don't use their willpower as a last-ditch defense to stop themselves from disaster, These people have less need to use willpower because they're beset by fewer temptations and inner conflicts. They're better at arranging their lives so that they avoid problem situations.

# Other Notes

In psychology, brilliant theories are cheap. People like to think of the field advancing thanks to some thinker's startling new insight, but that's not how it usually works. Coming up with ideas isn't the hard part. Everyone has a pet theory for why we do what we do, which is why psychologists get sick of hearing their discoveries dismissed with "Oh, my grandmother knew that." **Progress generally comes not from theories but from someone finding a clever way to test a theory.**
Alcohol doesn't increase your impulse to do stupid or destructive things; instead, it simply removes restraints. It lessens self-control in two ways: by lowering blood glucose and by reducing self-awareness.

## Always Get Enough Energy

The children who got breakfast learned more and misbehaved less.
Glucose depletion can turn the most charming companion into a monster. The old advice about eating a good breakfast applies all day long, particularly on days when you're physically or mentally stressed. If you have a test, an important meeting, or a vital project, don't take it on without glucose. Don't get into an argument with your boss four hours after lunch. Don't thrash out serious problems with your partner just before dinner. When you're on a romantic trip across Europe, don't drive into a walled medieval town at seven P.M. and try to navigate to your hotel on an empty stomach. Your car can probably survive the cobblestone maze, but your relationship might not. Above all, don't skimp on calories when you're trying to deal with more serious problems than being overweight.

### Women in Luteal Phase

During this premenstrual part of the cycle, which is called the luteal phase, the female body starts channeling a high amount of its energy to the ovaries and to related activities, like producing extra quantities of female hormones. As more energy and glucose are diverted to the reproductive system, there's less available for the rest of the body, which responds by craving more fuel. Chocolate and other sweets are immediately appealing because they provide instant glucose, but any kind of food can help, which is why women report more food cravings and tend to eat more. One study found that the average woman eats about 810 calories at lunch during this time, which is about 170 calories more than what she eats at lunch during the rest of the month. But most women still aren't getting enough extra calories. The typical woman in a modern thin-conscious society like America does not take in enough extra food to supply the body's increased demands for glucose during these few days each month. When there isn't enough energy to go around, the body has to ration it, and the reproductive system takes priority, leaving less glucose available for willpower. As a general rule, women are less likely than men to suffer from lapses of self-control, but their self-control problems do worsen during the luteal phase, as studies have repeatedly shown. During this phase, women spend more money and make more impulsive purchases than at other times. They smoke more cigarettes. They drink more alcohol, and not just because they enjoy drinks more. The increase is especially

## About teenagers

Most people don't enjoy their first taste of alcohol or tobacco. Most people are scared to put unfamiliar drugs into their bodies. It takes real self-discipline to inject yourself with heroin the first time. Teenagers will disregard everything-their own fears, their parents' warnings, physical pain, the possibility of going to jail or dying-because they're convinced that social acceptance requires them not only to take risks but to do so in a cool, seemingly unconcerned manner. They exert self-control to overcome their inhibitions and more self-control to hide their negative feelings.

## What You Should Know about Diet

The body might send you pain signals when you exercise too strenuously, but it doesn't treat jogging as an existential threat. Dieting is different. As the young Oprah Winfrey discovered, the body will go along with a diet once or twice-but then it starts fighting back. When fat lab rats are put on a controlled diet for the first time, they'll lose weight. But if they're then allowed to eat freely again, they'll gradually fatten up, and if they're put on another diet it will take them longer to lose the weight this time. Then, when they once again go off the diet, they'll regain the weight more quickly than the last time. By the third or fourth time they go through this boom-and-bust cycle, the dieting ceases to work; the extra weight stays on even though they're consuming fewer calories. Evolution favored people who could survive famines, so once a body has gone through the experience of not getting enough to eat, it reacts by fighting to keep all the pounds it has. When you diet, your body assumes there's a famine and hangs on to every fat cell it can.
Dieters have a fixed target in mind for their maximum daily calories, and when they exceed it for some unexpected reason, such as being given a pair of large milkshakes in an experiment, they regard their diet as blown for the day. That day is therefore mentally classified as a failure, regardless of what else happens. Virtue cannot resume until tomorrow. So they think, What the hell, I might as well enjoy myself today-and the resulting binge often puts on far more weight than the original lapse.
Yes, obese people ignored their inner cues, but that's not why they became obese. It worked the other way: Their obesity made them likely to go on diets, and their diets caused them to rely on external instead of internal cues. For what is a diet but a plan imposing external rules? Dieters learn to eat according to a plan, not to their inner feelings and cravings. Dieting means being hungry a lot of the time (even if the marketers of diets are always promising otherwise). More precisely, dieting means learning not to eat when you are hungry, preferably by learning to ignore those feelings of hunger. You mainly try to tune out the start-eating signal, but the start and stop signals are intertwined, so you typically lose touch with the stop-eating signal, too, particularly if the diet tells you exactly how much to eat. You eat by the rules, which works fine as long as you stick to them. But once you deviate from the rules, as just about everyone does, you have nothing left to guide you. That's why, even after downing a couple of big milkshakes, dieters and obese people not only continue but increase their eating. The milkshakes filled them up, but they still don't feel full. They have only the one bright line, and once they have passed it, there are no more limits.

## Why You Feel Sleepy During the Cold

The muscles, not surprisingly, use plenty of glucose, as do the heart and liver. The immune system uses large quantities, but only sporadically. When you're relatively healthy, your immune system may use only a relatively small amount of glucose. But when your body is fighting off a cold, it may consume gobs of it. That's why sick people sleep so much: The body uses all the energy it can to fight the disease, and it can't spare much for exercising, making love, or arguing. It can't even do much thinking, a process that requires plentiful glucose in the bloodstream. The glucose itself doesn't enter the brain, but it's converted into neurotransmitters, which are the chemicals that your brain cells use to send signals. If you ran out of neurotransmitters, you'd stop thinking.
